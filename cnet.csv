This story is part of CNET Zero, a series that chronicles the impact of climate change and explores what's being done about the problem.

With 70% of the Earth's surface covered by oceans, wave power could arguably be one of our largest untapped energy resources. If you've ever been knocked off your feet by a big wave, you've felt a smidgeon of that power. 

For decades, scientists and engineers have looked to our vast oceans and dreamed of ways to extract a tiny fraction of that energy. In an era of climate awareness and anxiety, finding ways to do that is finally getting more attention. 

The Biden administration's Ocean Climate Action Plan reveals how the ocean holds important potential for renewable energy, both from offshore wind power and less-explored sources such as waves, tides and currents. Even the chillier waters that lie deep below tropical seas could provide clean marine energy.

The plan acknowledges an ambitious endeavor nearing completion off the coast of Oregon, where 7 miles of conduit were laid under the floor of the Pacific Ocean using pioneering horizontal drilling techniques. Soon, thick cables will be run through that conduit to connect the mainland to PacWave, an offshore experimental testbed built to develop and demonstrate new technology that converts the power of waves into onshore electricity. 

Once fully operational (as soon as 2025), PacWave could generate up to 20 megawatts, enough to power a few thousand homes. ""I get really excited about wave energy because the resource is so large,"" Levi Kilcher, a senior scientist with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, told me.

Kilcher is a lead author on the 2021 NREL report that compiled available data on marine energy sources in the US, including waves, tides and ocean currents. The team found that the total energy potential is equal to more than half (57%) of the electricity generated in the US in a single year.  

""I get really excited about wave energy because the resource is so large.""
Levi Kilcher, senior scientist, National Renewable Energy Laboratory

Though experimental sites like PacWave point to an efficient way to harvest wave power and could facilitate breakthroughs, wave energy still has a way to go before becoming a significant source of electricity. Though waves are steady, they aren't identical, posing a key challenge in designing a machine to capture their energy.

""You're trying to tune [the technological approach] so you can take advantage of these shifting kinds of waves,"" said Andrea Copping, a senior researcher at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

Differing approaches to capturing wave energy include devices that ride the top of waves or ones that translate the pressure waves put on the seafloor into power. Another approach involves devices called oscillating water columns, which compress air as waves rush through them. That compressed air spins a turbine and generates energy.

Power from the depths

Waves are just one potential source of marine energy that scientists and officials are investigating. 

Copping says there's renewed interest in another form of marine energy: ocean thermal energy conversion, or OTEC, which involves bringing up colder water from deeper parts of the ocean. This chilly flow then goes through a heat exchange process with warmer surface water, similar to the way home heat pumps exchange hot and cold air. That process drives a turbine to generate electricity. 

OTEC technology was pioneered in the 1970s when energy prices soared, but it never really caught on. According to Copping, climate change has led to more attention on OTEC, which could be a fit for islands like Puerto Rico, Guam and small nations in the South Pacific. 

""There's a real interest, and we really think it's going to go this time,"" Copping said.

A small OTEC plant has been functioning in Hawaii for years. Copping believes new commitments from the US government hold promise for the future of the technology, which has also seen significant interest in Japan and other surrounding nations. 

It's possible that concern over climate change could unlock new sources of funding for OTEC. In the meantime, building smaller facilities (10 megawatts or less) and putting them on land instead of floating on the ocean is making the tech more affordable, Copping said.

There's also the added bonus that the cold water pipes can double as a form of air conditioning in the tropical locales where OTEC works best. 

Going with the flow

Much of the US coastline, like Alaska, the Pacific Northwest and the rocky shores of Maine, has climates where there's little chance of finding surface water warm enough for OTEC. Fortunately, some of these spots are optimal for generating power from a source that relies on shallower water: tides. 

Growing up in Alaska, Kilcher was always fascinated by the power of tides. But he had no idea that nearby Cook Inlet is considered one of the world's ideal spots for harnessing their energy. When Kilcher first started work at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, he was surprised when his colleagues informed him that this hometown of Homer, Alaska, was among the best tidal energy spots in the world. 

When it comes to converting the ocean's movements into electricity, tidal energy technology is the most developed -- it's about as simple as putting the right turbine in the right place in the water. A number of tidal-power projects have already been deployed in Europe and elsewhere, as well as in niche applications around the world. 

Tidal energy is the yin to the yang of wave energy. Waves can be anywhere and everywhere, but they're hard to predict. Tides are a mostly known quantity and are global, but their power potential is restricted to a few very specific places. The fast flows required to generate power are typically only found in narrow channels or between islands and the mainland. Still, where tidal energy works, it's a very reliable form of renewable energy.

""One thing that makes tidal energy especially attractive is it's 100% predictable,"" Kilcher said. 

Waves (the tallest in red and shortest in blue) arrive along the west coast of the United States in this accelerated animation.

Some smaller experiments are being run with other consistent characteristics of oceans besides tides, like their major, slow-moving currents. Kilcher noted that research is underway off the coast of the southeastern US to examine how much power can be pulled out of currents before impacting heat circulation patterns in the North Atlantic.  

""You don't want to be extracting so much energy that the Gulf Stream starts to shut down,"" he said. ""These are the kind of scientific research questions that we look at.""

Thar she blows

So far, effectively pulling power from the ocean has less to do with water than with the air above it. Offshore wind energy is by far the most productive source of power that we transfer from ocean to land. 

""Offshore wind is the most mature technology without a doubt,"" Bryson Robertson, director of the Pacific Marine Energy Center at Oregon State University, told me. ""We've been working on wind energy systems really since the birth of civilization. We were running sails [on boats], and we were using windmills to grind wheat.""

""We've been working on wind energy systems really since the birth of civilization. We were running sails [on boats], and we were using windmills to grind wheat.""
Bryson Robertson, director, Pacific Marine Energy Center at Oregon State University

Large, power-generating wind turbines anchored to the seafloor have become a familiar sight off the coast of the northeastern states and other locales. Robertson says that floating offshore wind turbines are a newer, promising technology that could help scale up the amount of electricity we literally pull out of thin air.

Wind is more consistent offshore, and floating infrastructure can be deployed in more parts of the world and on deeper seas. And taller turbines could access high-altitude winds in locations that are out of the view of the public.

Robertson believes the opportunities to generate more wind power from floating infrastructure are significant enough to make a real dent in carbon emissions. 

A tough environment

Unlike developing a new mobile app or even a mobile phone, building the infrastructure to pull power from one of the most inhospitable and untamed environments on Earth can be a slow, difficult process. 

""We know less about these tidal raises, these big wave areas because we stay out of them,"" Copping said. ""That's one of the reasons this is taking time. But just look at the ocean -- it's hard not to see the energy potential.""

There are also a number of other considerations, including the impacts marine energy infrastructure could have on wildlife, the broader environment, local populations, fishing and other industries.

A research diver inspects a hydrophone lander deployed on the seafloor as part of ongoing research to improve the environmental monitoring of marine energy devices. 

Richard Walsh/Scripps Institution of Oceanography

""I think the biggest issue is uncertainty,"" Robertson added. ""We haven't done this at scale before, so what are the environmental impacts going to be?""

He says the policy process may be slow for good reasons, but the need for marine energy is still urgent.

""We need to find a way to deploy technology faster while being cognizant of the environment,"" he said. ""We just need to find a way to accelerate this process if we're going to have a measurable impact on climate change.""

This story is part of CNET Zero, a series that chronicles the impact of climate change and explores what's being done about the problem.

Back in 2016, I drove over 1,000 miles from the UK to Barcelona on electric power alone. It was an odyssey, with difficult-to-find chargers resulting in big delays, almost costing me my job. This year, with so many improvements to the EV infrastructure across Europe, I tried it again. 

It wasn't just easier this time. It was downright bliss. 

My 2016 journey was supposed to be simple. I had taken a Tesla Model S -- a car with 300 miles range per charge -- to Barcelona to attend the Mobile World Congress tech show for CNET. I relied on Tesla's Supercharger network that recharged the car in around 30 to 40 minutes. I had calculated the distances between the chargers and was confident I could make the journey in the allotted time. 

I was naive.

Achieving the car's maximum range was difficult at inefficient highway speeds. None of the superchargers were easily accessible, with most being in the back of business hotels on commercial estates far from the highways, resulting in long setbacks. I arrived in Barcelona almost 9 hours late. My boss wasn't happy. 

But all of this has changed. In 2016, France had around 15,000 public EV chargers, but as of December 2022, that number has ballooned to over 82,000. And a huge number are fast chargers situated at highway rest stops, meaning that taking your electric vehicle on a long-distance trip is quicker and more manageable.

It was easy to find fast-charging spots using the Shell Recharge app. 

Andrew Lanxon/CNET

I did this year's long-distance journey in early March to attend the 2023 Mobile World Congress again. I drove the VW ID 5, an all-electric SUV with a range of up to 314 miles. Setting off with a full battery from North London at 4 a.m., I used Google Maps to go straight to the Channel Tunnel departures on the UK's South Coast, getting the car onto the train that would take me under the sea, and then emerging in Calais, France, around 40 minutes later.

Driving a non-Tesla EV, I had to rely on third-party public chargers, which I was able to find using the Shell Recharge app. Thankfully, there are plenty of options now, such as Ionity, Total, Shell and others offering fast 150kW charging (or higher, in many cases) that would take the car to 80% in around 30 minutes. The Shell Recharge app shows all brands and allows you to pay through the app. (Most chargers don't accept contactless credit cards, and instead require ID cards specific to the service.)

Driving the car onto a train beneath the sea is always fun.

Andrew Lanxon/CNET

With the app, I found my way to the first Ionity fast-charging station, situated at a rest stop on the highway southeast of Calais. This was already a big improvement over my last journey -- I didn't have to drive 20 minutes or more to find a charger behind an Ibis or Mercure hotel. And since it was a rest stop, I was able to get a coffee and a croissant while the car charged. By the time I'd finished my breakfast and stretched my legs, the car was ready to go. 

The massive increase in charging stations meant that brimming the EV battery wasn't difficult. Seven years ago, I had to map out the exact route to maximize efficiency and avoid getting stuck without power. This time, I just pointed the car down the highway direct to Barcelona, hopping between fast chargers as needed.

Before hitting the South Coast en route to my destination, I made an overnight stop just North of Lyon. I'm glossing over about 15 hours of travel because it was totally unremarkable -- which in and of itself is remarkable. There was no shortage of chargers, no problems or long waits at the chargers and, as a result, no range anxiety. It was an easy drive, just like it would be in a gas-powered (petrol) car. I was impressed. Even in 2021 in Scotland, I had problems with entire banks of chargers being out of order for weeks at a time.

The VW ID 5 was comfortable to drive every mile of my journey. 

Andrew Lanxon/CNET

The VW ID 5 made it an extremely comfortable journey -- smooth to drive, with adaptive cruise control and steering assistance to maintain lane position -- and the highway miles simply flew by. Even the seats felt supportive for the long stints between breaks, and the sound system made my Periphery-heavy playlist boom. 

I reached Barcelona early on my third day and stowed the car in a downtown parking lot for the duration of the conference. Before leaving, I plotted a route to a fast charger just outside the city, where I gave it a full top-off while having breakfast. My return route was a bit rural, snaking my way up through the French Dordogne region, where charging was certain to be difficult. 

There are far fewer chargers away from the main intercity highways and even fewer fast chargers. In the historic village of La Roque-Gageac, there was a charging station for just one vehicle, but it was out of order. Fortunately, the generous range of the ID 5 gave me enough power to get 30 minutes north to a fast charger outside the town of Montignac. 

By relying on fast chargers, I didn't have wait long to get back on the road.

Andrew Lanxon/CNET

Throughout my entire journey, totaling over 2,000 miles, it was the only instance I had to make an adjustment to my charging route. And given how taxing I've found other long-distance EV road trips, that was wonderful. 

Instead of having to keep one eye constantly on the range, I could enjoy the beautiful journey through the South of France countryside. The ID 5's range combined with the number of public chargers in France meant I didn't need to overly plan my route and could instead go charging when I needed to. 

It was exactly what a road trip should be -- genuinely experiencing the pleasure of the drive and not having to worry about the logistics of refueling. I'm encouraged that the huge investment in EV infrastructure across Europe has made long-distance travel more feasible, not just for business trips, but for families trying to avoid spending hours at slow chargers with impatient children. 

Ionity fast chargers were plentiful, and I never had to wait to charge.

Andrew Lanxon/CNET

Had I done the 2,100-mile journey in a gas-powered car, I would have spent around £409 ($510), based on burning fuel at 35 mpg and refueling at 150 pence per liter. With an EV, I spent only around £308 ($384) on electricity -- big savings. And that's despite the energy crisis in Europe hiking up the cost of electricity, and also despite my pay-as-you-go charging method being more expensive than using a charging provider's subscription plans. Plus, the Shell Recharge app tells me I saved around 450 kg of CO2 on my electric-only journey.

My EV experience was very different from what I found back in 2016.

Andrew Lanxon/CNET

Sure, there's still room for improvement. Rural driving is trickier than it is on major highways, and I don't know why all chargers don't accept contactless credit cards (a common problem with charging stations in the US, too). There are a wide number of charging operators, and while most can use the Shell app (or a similar app called Bonnet), others didn't allow any app payments. Relying on the app also means you need cellular service to authorize the payment, something that may not be available in rural areas (although I had no reception problems on my trip).

Overall, I'm pleased that my fresh attempt at this journey was a success. And I'm extremely pleased at how easy it's become to drive zero-emission EVs in Europe.

Energy Vault's first large-scale gravity storage system is under construction in China and should be complete by June.

Energy Vault
This story is part of CNET Zero, a series that chronicles the impact of climate change and explores what's being done about the problem.

Imagine a gigantic brick, packed full of tightly compressed dirt. As big as a pickup truck but -- at 24 tons -- about five times heavier. An elevator powered by solar panels or wind turbines hoists it over 300 feet up the side of a huge building. A trolley stows it inside, but it's not alone. An automated system lifts and stores hundreds more bricks, like giant Pez candies, as the sun shines and the wind blows.

Now imagine the building's control system lowering those hundreds of bricks one by one, spinning electrical power generators in the process. They drop down every evening just as demand for power peaks but solar panel output fades away.

In effect, the brick-filled building is a giant battery that stores energy with gravity instead of chemistry.

Gravity batteries are a potentially important solution to a critical problem with the green energy revolution: making sure electricity is available when we need it, not just during the times when sun and wind supply it.

And it isn't just an idea. With two sites under construction — one in Rudong, China, just north of Shanghai, and the other in Snyder, Texas, about 250 miles west of Dallas — startup Energy Vault will begin seriously testing the viability of the gravity storage technology. An earlier pilot generated 5 megawatts of power, but these two facilities and expected successors will show whether gravity storage is economical and efficient enough to work at large scale.

Power when the sun goes down

You may think putting solar panels on your roof will help fight climate change, but without some form of energy storage in your home or on the grid, you'll likely rely on carbon dioxide-spewing gas and coal power plants to run your home's lights, TV and dishwasher as the sun sets.

Energy Vault tested its technology at a smaller scale in Switzerland, where the 170-person company is headquartered. Its two EVx systems under construction are much bigger. The Chinese system, built for waste management and recycling company China Tianying, is in a 400-foot-tall building and will have an energy storage capacity of 100 megawatt-hours. That's enough to power 3,400 homes for an entire day, and the system should be complete by June. The Texas system, in a 460-foot-tall (but narrower) building, will provide power company Enel with 36MWh of capacity.

Solar panels and wind turbines now generate power more cheaply than coal and natural gas plants, making them a clear choice in the push to replace fossil fuels. Solar power costs dropped 83% from 2009 to 2023 and wind costs dropped 63% over the same period, according to tracking from investment advisory and asset management firm Lazard. But in many parts of the country, new solar panels often just supply a glut of power during the middle of the day without helping in the evenings.

The mismatch between power production and power usage is responsible for the infamous ""duck curve

EditSign

,"" a graph with a birdlike shape showing the disparity increasing with each passing year. That disparity makes it hard for utilities to adjust to rapid changes in demand and means fossil fuel powered sources like natural gas ""peaker plants"" supply power in the evenings.

""If we're ever going to wean ourselves more and more off of fossil fuels and replace that with renewable generation that's intermittent, the only way to solve that is storage,"" said Energy Vault Chief Executive Robert Piconi.

Best Portable Power Stations for 2023

Energy Vault isn't alone. Another startup, Gravitricity, has built a 250-kilowatt demonstration system and is planning a larger 4MW to 8MW system in an unused mine shaft.

Energy storage cost is key

Gravity storage is just one way to smooth out the spurts of wind and solar. Big batteries like Tesla Megapacks — industrial-scale versions of the same batteries that power your phone or electric vehicle — are increasingly common on the power grid. ""Pumped hydro,"" an older form of gravity battery that pumps water to an uphill reservoir then generates power when it flows back downhill, has been used for decades but is attracting new interest. Other methods include filling underground chambers with compressed air, storing hydrogen that later powers fuel cells, and developing different types of batteries, like zinc batteries and flow batteries.

Energy Vault's EVx system hoists these 24-ton bricks up hundreds of feet to then recapture that potential energy by lowering them when power is needed. The bricks are made of compressed dirt with a polymer matrix and are shuttled within the system using a trolley setup beneath the bricks.

Energy Vault

Cost will be a major factor in determining what storage technology prevails, including initial manufacturing and continuing operations.

""At the end of the day it will all come down to price,"" said Selene Law, an energy analyst at consulting firm Cleantech Group. And for gravity storage, questions about total cost persist, she said.

Indeed, a 2022 US Department of Energy study concluded that gravity energy storage is relatively expensive in smaller installations. Where it's most economical is in high-capacity systems that generate power for relatively long periods of time — 10 hours or more.

Energy Vault hasn't disclosed the cost of the two systems under construction, but it agrees the technology offers advantages for long-duration power needs.

Longevity is a cost factor over the lifetime of the plant. Batteries lose capacity with use, the same way your phone doesn't run as long after a couple of years of ownership, but gravity storage components, like pulleys and generators, can be maintained.

""The key of our value proposition is the lack of degradation of the storage medium,"" said Marco Terruzzin, a mechanical engineer and Energy Vault's chief commercial product officer. ""We provide a guarantee on the system for at least 35 years.""

Though Energy Vault has taken only its first steps in proving the technology's value, two customers have concluded it's worth paying for today. And the 100MWh system in China is only the first there, the company said. The country expects to fund another 4GWh to 6GWh of capacity later — an increase of 40 to 60 times the initial plant.

How Energy Vault's EVx works

Energy Vault's gravity EVx storage system is a giant rectangular building that largely runs automatically. Here's how it works.

The bricks at the heart of the system each measure 3.5 by 2.7 by 1.3 meters (about 11 by 9 by 4 feet) and weigh 24 metric tons. They're made of 99% compressed dirt with some water and a polymer mixture to stabilize it using a recipe from Mexican building materials company Cemex. They're 2.4 times denser than water and about the same as concrete.

Energy Vault's first large-scale gravity-based energy storage system in Rudong, China, is hundreds of feet tall.

Energy Vault

The bricks are stored side by side within the building, like dominoes jammed together. Before they're raised or lowered, a trolley system hefts each brick and trundles it to the elevator.

Bricks are housed on the top eight levels of the building to store energy and drop down to the corresponding lower eight levels to generate power. Each brick, descending at 1.9 meters per second (6.23 feet), turns out about a megawatt, Terruzzin said. That's about enough to power 2,000 refrigerators.

Once each brick reaches the bottom, it's robotically transferred to the trolley system and moved toward the center of the building.

Making the building longer, with longer trolley tracks, means more bricks can be stored for more hours of power generation. Making the building wider, with more elevators, means the system can generate a higher peak power rate.

As for efficiency, Energy Vault guarantees EVx systems will generate at least 80% of the energy required to lift the bricks and scoot them around, including factors like friction. That overall efficiency is comparable to pumped hydro.

Key to Energy Vault's business is the control system that decides when and where to position the bricks for optimal storage and even energy output.

""While we're decelerating one at the bottom, the next one is loading and beginning to accelerate,"" said Bill Gross, Idealabs chief executive and Energy Vault co-founder, speaking at the Techonomy Climate conference in March.

The maximum output will be 25MW at the China system and 18MW at the Texas system.

Overcoming gravity storage challenges

Energy Vault settled on its current design after evaluating several other options — gravel in carts, water in tanks, concrete blocks hanging from cranes.

The EVx is designed to overcome problems with those designs. It's weatherproof, which means bricks don't get wet or blown around, for example.

Energy Vault isn't putting all its energy storage eggs in the gravity basket. A contract with California's Pacific Gas and Electric, could result in a system to power the city of Calistoga for up to 48 hours with a combination of hydrogen fuel cells and batteries. Hybrid systems with gravity and battery storage also make sense, since batteries can respond very rapidly to increase or decrease, Terruzzin said.

With Energy Vault's plants headed into production, we should start getting a better idea this year how well gravity storage really works. ""This will be a crucial year for Energy Vault,"" Cleantech Group's Law said. ""The proof will be in the pudding.""

The company isn't profitable, reporting a net loss of $78 million for 2022 on revenue of $146 million. And its stock has slumped by 89% over the last year, a fate many startups suffered with economic troubles and skeptical investors.

Energy Vault's Piconi is convinced the company is on the right path toward making energy storage more economical, though.

""Wind and solar are so much cheaper than fossil fuels now... The problem is storage is typically 10 to 15 times that,"" Piconi said. ""We have to get there.""

Correction, 9:26 a.m. PT: A previous version of this story misstated Energy Vault's 2022 financial results. It reported a net loss of $78 million on revenue of $146 million.

More than half a dozen states are slated to join California in prohibiting the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035.

This story is part of CNET Zero, a series that chronicles the impact of climate change and explores what's being done about the problem.

Starting in 2035, California will prohibit the sale of new gas-powered cars. A measure  approved by the California Air Resources Board requires all new cars, SUVs and pickup trucks sold in the state to generate zero tailpipe emissions by then. The policy won't take existing cars off the road, but automakers and car dealers will be restricted to selling electric vehicles and certain plug-in hybrids.

""Our cars shouldn't make wildfires worse -- and create more days filled with smoky air,"" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said iwhen announcing the executive order that created the rule in 2020. ""Cars shouldn't melt glaciers or raise sea levels, threatening our cherished beaches and coastlines.""

The Advanced Clean Cars II rule requires zero-emission vehicles to represent 35% of new cars and light trucks in lots by 2026, and then  68% by 2030, before reaching 100% in 2035.

When it comes to emissions, California is a bellwether: Six states that link their standards to California's have already announced plans to prohibit the sale of new ICE automobiles after 2035, and more could follow.

Seventeen states follow California's rules, but so far only Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Washington have announced they'll enforce the Advanced Clean Cars II rule and prohibit the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles.

In November, the Vermont legislature approved changes to clean-car requirements that would require new cars sold in the state to be zero-emission vehicles by 2030, WCAX reported.  Secretary of State Sarah Copeland Hanzas, who must approved the policy, did not respond to a request for comment.

Colorado has adopted California's zero-emission policies in the past, but Gov. Jared Polis has rejected the idea of a ban. Instead, his administration has said state agencies will focus on making EVs more affordable and practical. Announced in March, the Colorado Electric Vehicle plan sets a goal of EVs accounting for at least 80% of new car sales by 2032, compared with slightly more than 10% in 2022.

In Virginia, the outlook is more muddled: Republican lawmakers are fighting to decouple the state from California's emissions rules, but their last bill was defeated in February. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin has still vowed to overturn what he called a ""ridiculous edict,"" according to WTOP News.

And while Minnesota's 2021 Clean Car Rule links it to California's standards, it doesn't automatically trigger a ban on ICE vehicles. State Rep. Jamie Long, chair of the state Climate and Energy Finance and Policy Committee, said the likelihood of such a prohibition ""is probably low,"" MinnPost reported. Car dealers in the state sued to get the Clean Car Rule struck down in January but failed.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, meanwhile, has called for 20% of cars on Minnesota roads to be electric by 2030, up from 1% today.

Can I still buy a used car?

The regulations don't force anyone to stop driving their current automobile or prevent them from buying a used car. They also don't prevent you from buying an ICE vehicle in another state and registering it locally.

The average lifespan of a car is about 12 years or 200,000 miles, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, so there will be ICE cars available in the affected states for some time.

Bans on the sale of gas-powered cars don't include used vehicles or those purchased out-of-state.

Are medium- and heavy-duty vehicles included in the gas-powered ban?

According to the California Energy Commission, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles -- like public buses and trucks weighing more than 14,000 pounds -- ""produce a disproportionately large portion of the state's greenhouse gas emissions.""

Advanced Clean Cars II calls for new medium- and heavy-duty vehicles to be 100% zero-emission by 2045 ""where feasible."" 

California is set to prohibit the sale of large diesel trucks in 2036.

Is there a nationwide ban on gas-powered cars?

President Joe Biden has set a goal of having half of all new vehicle sales in the US be electric by 2030. To achieve that, he earmarked $5 billion to create a nationwide infrastructure of charging stations and revised the EV tax credit to spur domestic production.

But the White House has not floated an outright prohibition on new ICE vehicles.

Biden's Federal Sustainability Plan does require government agencies to transition to only buying zero-emission light-duty vehicles by 2027 and medium- and heavy-duty vehicles by 2035.

The White House announced in April that the federal government had already acquired 13,000 light- and medium-duty zero-emission vehicles in 2023, roughly four times the number it had bought in all of 2022.

Which carmakers will no longer produce gas-powered vehicles?

With increased demand and government regulations, a number of leading auto companies have shared timelines for when they plan to phase out ICE vehicles.

General Motors has said it will sell only zero-emission cars by the time California's ban takes effect in 2035. By 2040, GM said, it will be carbon-neutral both in its vehicles and manufacturing operations.

Other carmakers vowing to go all-electric include Jaguar (2025), Volvo (2030), Rolls-Royce (2030) and Honda (2040).

Ford has pledged to ditch gas-powered cars in 2030, but only in Europe.

Stellantis -- parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat and Jeep -- has said 100% of its sales in Europe and 50% of sales in the US will be battery electric vehicles by the end of the decade.

That's when Mercedes-Benz says it will cease production of gas-powered vehicles ""where market conditions allow."" The German automaker has promised to offer battery-electric versions of all its models by 2025.

Volkswagen plans to go all-electric in Europe by 2033.

Kia and Hyundai both have plans to ramp up their EV offerings, though neither has said anything about ending the production of ICE models.

Back in 2017, Toyota said it would phase out gas-powered vehicles by 2040. But while the Japanese automaker has led the way with hybrids, Toyota director Shigeki Terashi said in a 2021 investors' call that it was ""too early to concentrate on one option,"" at least until 2050.

In January, incoming CEO Koji Sato said ""the time is right'' for an EV-first approach. But at the Davos summit that same month, Toyota Chief Scientist Gill Pratt argued that the scarcity of lithium for EV batteries made an all-in approach unfeasible.

""These shortages -- not only of battery materials, but of charging infrastructure -- will make it abundantly clear that one size does not fit all,"" Pratt said, Automotive News reported. ""and that the best answer is actually a mix of different vehicle types.""

Lexus, Toyota's luxury brand, is slated to go fully electric by 2035.

Protests against wind turbines can hold up development.

mtreasure/Getty Images
This story is part of CNET Zero, a series that chronicles the impact of climate change and explores what's being done about the problem.

If everything goes to plan, construction on the second-biggest wind energy project on the planet will start in the second half of 2023.

 The SunZia Wind and Transmission project ambitiously combines a 3.5-gigawatt wind farm in New Mexico with 500 miles of transmission lines to transport that energy to Arizona. It's a critical undertaking in the US, a country in dire need of more renewable energy and an expanded grid. 

But the road to construction has been arduous. The first permits for the project were submitted 14 years ago in 2009, laying bare an urgent problem. Part of the reason there aren't more projects like SunZia is the time it takes to get clearance to build green energy infrastructure.

The Biden administration has proposed an admirable goal of decarbonizing the grid by 2035, which would require a fivefold increase in renewables. The government will funnel historic amounts of money into green energy, over $400 billion via the Inflation Reduction Act alone, to achieve that goal. Yet the glacial pace with which energy projects move threatens the objective. Wind and solar farms, geothermal power plants and hydroelectric dams take between five and 15 years to get construction authorization. 

At the center of the issue is the National Environmental Protection Act, which requires companies to perform environmental assessments of their energy projects to ensure the preservation of local ecology. This process is necessary, but some argue that it's bloated. 

The median timespan for NEPA reviews is between four and six years, says Rayan Sud of the Brookings Institute's Center for Regulation and Markets. SunZia's 14-year travail is on the extreme end, but Sud said it's not highly unusual for environmental assessments to take 10 years. Then, and only then, can the building start. 

And that can be where the real problems begin, says Hunter Armistead, CEO of Pattern Energy, the company now helming SunZia. NEPA allows local groups to challenge the government's decision to grant permits, which can delay the construction process further.

""It effectively keeps adding more and more requirements,"" Armistead said.

Some challenges to clean energy projects are done out of blatant self-interest — for instance, objecting to wind turbines deflating property values by ruining an ocean view. In other cases, groups of ""concerned locals"" are revealed to be backed by the fossil fuel industry. But often those fighting back against green energy projects are genuinely concerned about fauna and flora.

At odds are two different strands of environmentalism. Proponents of a green revolution want to preserve the planet by mitigating global warming. That requires massive amounts of new renwable energy, the construction of which is often opposed by people trying to protect wildlife and vulnerable ecosystems. 

Minnesota's Boundary Waters, known for wildlife and canoeing, was among the first areas to be saved by the National Environmental Protection Act.

Protecting the environment

The current status quo was put in place by President Richard Nixon, a rather unlikely environmental conservationist. Alongside the NEPA, his administration signed legislation that set standards for air quality, regulated pollutants released into the ocean and protected endangered animals. 

While these laws can make greenlighting new renewable energy projects difficult, they have been necessary safeguards for the environment. 

Lisa Frank, head of advocacy at Environment America, points to the example of Minnesota's Boundary Waters, invaluable land that's home to beavers, timber wolves, moose and over 240 other animal species. The Forest Service had planned to permit private logging in the early '70s before an environmental assessment showed such an operation would have ruined the ecology. It was an early example of NEPA in action. 

Forty years later, in 2022, the same process saved the Boundary Waters from a planned nickel mining operation. It's one of countless ecologies NEPA and its sister laws have saved. 

""It definitely sometimes can take a long time to get projects built,"" Frank said, ""but that alone doesn't indicate there's something wrong with the process."" She believes bigger barriers to green energy construction include subsidies to the fossil fuel industry and resistance from utilities uneager to see the cost of electricity reduced. 

Pattern Energy's Armistead agrees that the NEPA is crucial and says that many local objections to power projects are justified. The issue is over how slow government turnaround often is. The Bureau of Land Management took six years to issue its first permit for the SunZia project. When a permit is rescinded based on community pushback, it can take months or years to be regranted, even after those concerns are ameliorated.

""One of the core issues we've been hoping to get more clarity on is what actually has to be done [to obtain a permit], and that there are specific turnaround times and response times from the government so you don't end up in a long, protracted wait,"" Armistead said.

It's not even that NEPA rules need to be relaxed, Armistead said. It's OK for a project to be rejected, but it's the unproductive waiting period that hurts. ""A lot of our projects, we've looked around and decided either for species or permitting reasons, this isn't the place to develop,"" he said. ""If you're going to fail, you'd much rather fail quickly."" 

The Biden Administration, through the Building a Better America and Inflation Reduction Act, has funneled unprecedented amounts of money into green energy.

Roadblocks to renewables

The environmental laws put in place by the Nixon administration responded to growing environmental sentiment in the '60s and '70s. But that was before climate change became an urgent concern. Fifty years later, environmentalism is at war with itself. On one side are conservationists, whose main goal is to preserve local ecologies. On the other are activists chiefly concerned with stopping human-made climate change.

""It's a genuinely hard question,"" said Sanjay Patnaik, director of the Center for Regulation and Markets. ""In the macro, we know we need to address [both] climate change and biodiversity. In the micro, which interest wins out in a given place?""

This battle is currently being fought near Martha's Vineyard, where an offshore wind farm called Vineyard Wind is intended to supply electricity to 400,000 Massachusetts homes. It's a crucial part of the state's pledge to reach net zero by 2050, and the federal government's plan to have 30 gigawatts of offshore wind power by 2030 (up from 42 megawatts in 2021). The Biden administration greenlit the project after it had been previously stalled by the Trump administration. 

Since then, Vineyard Wind has been sued by a group alleging the turbines will hamper the hauls of local fisheries, as well as by local citizens who say the project could affect endangered whales. It's typical of resistance to offshore wind, something Patnaik says is a US phenomenon. ""In Europe, you see much less of that,"" he said. As of 2021, Europe had over 30 times more offshore wind capacity than the US. 

In the US, many jurisdictions see local opposition by wealthy homeowners and landowners. ""If you look at the Eastern Seaboard for instance, a lot of these properties are owned by really rich people, and they don't want an impediment to their view,"" Patnaik said. Wind farms are easy targets to challenge because they take up more space than any other type of energy source — and because they have a tendency to ""ruin"" otherwise pristine vistas. 

Sud notes an additional hardship for offshore wind projects: Many ships that transport material from a state's shore into national waters require the approval of the EPA, something he says can take two years alone.

Expanding wind power and other renewable energy sources is just one part of the equation. Renewable energy is often produced in remote locations and needs to be transported to dense population centers. At the same time, the grid needs more electricity for services currently powered by fossil fuels, like heating and transport. In short, we'll need more transmission lines. 

""You have three almost nonconnected grids in the US,"" Sud explained. ""You've got a Western interconnection, an Eastern interconnection and then Texas. Only very, very small amounts of power flow between these three. … If you just put one or two transmission lines that connect East and West — or Texas and the East, or Texas and the West — that would be a huge deal.""

Unfortunately, transmission lines can be more troublesome to erect than wind turbines. Unlike gas pipelines, which can largely be approved by a federal body, transmission lines require approval from every jurisdiction they cross. That means not just states, but often counties too, ensuring a lengthy approval process. One 300-mile transmission project seeking to connect Oregon and Idaho is still in regulatory limbo, despite being proposed in 2007. 

Wind farms are generally harder to get approved than solar ones, and transmission lines are even harder.

Building the blueprint 

Permitting reform has caught the attention of lawmakers. Last year, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin proposed the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2022, a bill seeking to reduce timelines for building critical infrastructure down to three years or less from the current five to 10 years (or more). 

It was a polarizing bill for a polarizing issue. Some Congressional Democrats voted it down because it weakened environmental protections, said Patnaik, while many Republicans rejected it because Manchin, a Democrat, voted for Biden's Inflation Reduction Act.

Environment America's Lisa Frank counts herself as someone glad to see the bill fail, arguing that poor legislation seeking to reform permits could do more harm than good.

""Those proposals are written assuming that building more projects faster is generally in the public interest and anything that slows stuff down is bad,"" she said. ""Most projects undergoing NEPA review currently are still fossil fuel projects. Weakening the NEPA is at least in the near term going to have more benefit to fossil fuels than clean."" 

Patnaik and Sud would like the federal government to enact ""proactive permitting."" They advocate creating maps showing areas of low environmental sensitivity, where sites can be preapproved for certain types of energy production.

Pattern Energy's Armistead hopes that megaprojects like SunZia can lay a blueprint for others by highlighting what problems are likely to come up, what solutions are possible and how local communities can be won over.

""These are really hard things to do, but we need more big, hard things to get done,"" he said. ""If our world's going to decarbonize, it's hard to do it in small pieces."" 

The blueprint is still being drawn. In January, New Mexico gave SunZia the greenlight, with construction hoped to kickoff in April. Later that month, however, an Arizona resident filed a lawsuit arguing that the project would imperil the San Pedro River's fish, birds and mammals. 

Despite the disruption, construction should start later this year, Armistead said.

Electric vehicles will account for one in five new cars sold in 2023, according to the International Energy Agency.

Sales of electric vehicles are expected to increase 35% worldwide in 2023, according to a new report from the International Energy Agency, whose 42 member nations account for three-quarters of the planet's energy demand.  

Released Wednesday, the Global Electric Vehicle Outlook predicts that more than 14 million EVs will be sold by year's end, zooming past the record 10 million purchased in 2022. 

If accurate, that would mean roughly 20% of all new car sales were electric vehicles.

""Electric vehicles are one of the driving forces in the new global energy economy that is rapidly emerging,"" IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a statement, ""and they are bringing about a historic transformation of the car manufacturing industry worldwide.""

If the trend continues, Birol added, at least 5 million fewer barrels of oil a day will be needed worldwide by 2030.
""Cars are just the first wave,"" he said. ""Electric buses and trucks will follow soon.""

Electric vehicles accounted for 14% of the global automotive market in 2022, a threefold-plus expansion from 4% in 2020. 

By far, China is leading the charge: 60% of global EV sales last year were in China, according to the report, and the country is home to more than half of all zero-emissions vehicles on the road today. Europe and the US took second and third place, respectively.

The IEA predicted electric vehicles will average 60% of total vehicle sales in those three markets by 2030.

The agency pointed to government programs -- like the tax incentives and charging-station infrastructure baked into the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act -- as well as prices for smaller model EVs coming down to compete with combustion-engine autos in the next few years.

The report was also optimistic about EV growth in Southeast Asia, where two- and three-wheel models are more popular. In Thailand, EV sales doubled in 2022 to reach 3% of the market share, and in India and Indonesia, they tripled to 1.5%.

""A combination of effective policies and private sector investment is likely to increase these shares in the future,"" the IEA said.

This story is part of CNET Zero, a series that chronicles the impact of climate change and explores what's being done about the problem.

The world of our children will be different from ours. Our grandchildren's even more so. The crucial question: to what extent will that world be livable?

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its latest report last month — a synthesis of all the work it's done over the past few years to summarize the latest climate science. It noted that if urgent action is taken to tackle the climate crisis, a livable future can still be possible.

It's good news, but describing Earth's future as merely ""livable"" hardly paints an inspiring picture of what future generations have to look forward to. That feels like the bare minimum.

""A livable future is actually not such a difficult thing to define,"" said Lisa Schipper, an IPCC author and a professor in development geography at the University of Bonn. ""It refers to meeting basic human needs.""

Schipper's definition is useful but, digging deeper, the concept of a ""liveable future"" is more subjective than it initially appears. Our future relations could experience different livable futures depending on who and where they are, when they're alive, and, most crucially of all, the decisions our generation makes right now. The extent to which we can secure this future depends upon decisions made right now by governments and corporations. That in turn will be influenced by the collective power of citizens demanding they prioritize a habitable, sustainable future.

That could mean a small, wealthy elite hoarding exclusive access to an increasingly scarce set of resources over the next hundred years, while everyone else suffers. Equally, it could mean that people globally live in better harmony with the Earth's ecosystems and have the clean air, affordable housing and food security they need to get by, hundreds of years into the future. That livable future is up to us to imagine and fight for right now.

""As a baseline, the future that I'm fighting for is one in which every single person is able to live in dignity, to experience joy often and not be worrying about the things you need to survive,"" said climate activist Mikaela Loach, speaking at the launch of her book It's Not That Radical: Climate Action to Transform Our World in Edinburgh, Scotland, last month.

Something Loach says she wanted to make clear in her book was that this type of livable future is ""very possible."" The IPCC agrees. Its report shows us how to maximize our chances of making that livable future as good as it can be for as many people as possible. 

Livable, but for whom?

The question of what a livable future looks like raises another question: livable for whom? Right now, the effects are felt unequally. Those who are least responsible for climate change — the most vulnerable populations — experience the most adverse impacts.

Even now, at 1.1 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels, we're seeing firsthand the impacts of human-caused climate change. Significant, unpredictable weather events are causing death, destruction and displacement of people around the world. Arguably, some of the worst-hit areas could already be defined as unlivable by Schipper's definition.

One graphic in the IPCC report, showing how climate change will affect people born in different decades between 1950 and 2020, uses colored bands on human figures to indicate the amounts of warming they'll have to endure at various life stages. It demonstrates there is potential for those alive at the end of this century to live in a world not markedly warmer than the one we live in now. But they could also face one catastrophically warmer.

The IPCC graphic shows a range of different futures.

IPCC

If we reach 4 degrees of warming (the worst-case scenario and a projection mapped out by IPCC scientists as a possibility) it's reasonable to expect that even less of the world could meet the livable criteria.

To limit warming and keep as much of the world as livable as possible, the IPCC — along with other scientists and UN experts — are clear that change needs to happen. Much of that change will need to take place in the developed world across North America and Europe, among the countries that are the historical and present-day highest emitters due to burning fossil fuels for energy.

If governments and corporations in the developed world continue to chase profits and prioritize wealth, they do so at the expense of making things livable for the most vulnerable, explained Schipper. She is concerned that for many people on the planet, a livable future may already be out of reach due to the carbon usage of the world's wealthiest people, companies and countries.

""Many people — most in North America — are living far beyond what the Earth and climate can sustain,"" she said. ""Thus what they might think of as their future may have to be dramatically different to accommodate for a livable future for everyone.""

What it means to be livable, sustainable and dignified

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres described the March IPCC report as ""a how-to guide to defuse the climate time-bomb"" and ""a survival guide for humanity."" It lays out a number of pathways we could opt to follow over the next 77 years and beyond — a sort of choose your own adventure for the future of humanity. 

The best-case scenario pathways, which require totally abandoning fossil fuels, lead to a world with low emissions, where we can safeguard our ecosystems, protect global public health and ensure food security. It points to a future where justice and equity for all are built into the fabric of the systems we rely on. 

The extent of the global temperature rise can dictate quality of life in many different ways.

IPCC

Stan Cox, an environmentalist and author also writes in his book The Path to a Livable Future about a future that is not only livable and sustainable, but dignified. Expanding on this idea over email, he talked about the importance of redistributing power to allow for more self-determination among citizens, especially those who have been historically marginalized.

""A dignified future, in addition to being livable, would require that communities who have always been shoved to the sidelines come to play a pivotal role as we shape our collective future,"" he said. Wealth and ancestry would no longer empower a minority to decide what's best for everyone else, he added.

Eliminating our dependence on fossil fuels, and allowing this best-case scenario livable future to come to fruition, means tackling one of the biggest transformational challenges laid out by climate experts. Governments and corporations will need an entire mindset shift in order to give up ""on the mirage of unlimited economic growth,"" said Cox.

Instead of using the diminishing resources left on this Earth to generate profits, they will instead be needed for sustaining life, he added. ""If that can be achieved, those who follow us will live in a civilization that fits within ecosystems rather than plundering them.""

How to keep Earth livable? Embrace change

A livable future secured by sacrifice and change may not be what citizens, governments and profit-driven corporations in the developed world want to hear. But it's through being open to transforming our systems and ways of life that the future will be made more secure, as well as more equitable and just.

In an op-ed for The Conversation, two IPCC authors, Elisabeth Gilmore and Robert Lempert, demonstrate how proactive transformation on the part of government in collaboration with local citizens could ensure the longevity of many riverside communities that are currently at risk of being washed away and abandoned by the effects of climate change. 

""[The riverside community] might shift to higher ground, turn its riverfront into parkland while developing affordable housing for people who are displaced by the project, and collaborate with upstream communities to expand landscapes that capture floodwaters,"" they said.

In this example, the solution for riverside towns to be habitable can occur alongside the transition to renewable energy sources and green transportation. But it does require embracing what could be uncomfortable or seemingly inconvenient change — spending tax dollars, asking people to relocate and reconfiguring infrastructure. The alternative, however, is to do nothing, and risk these communities becoming obsolete.

This is a scaled-down, simplified version of the argument at the heart of the entire IPCC synthesis report. Wealthy people and institutions in the developed world have the choice to embrace change, however uncomfortable that might be, and keep the planet habitable, or to resist in favor of maintaining the status quo, and see the habitable regions of the Earth gradually wither away.

The more humanity heeds the warnings of the scientific community and takes proactive steps to embrace change, the more opportunity there is to design a livable future that works for everyone. The necessary solutions — as laid out in the IPCC report — are all there for the taking.

Beyond just survival 

This vision of a livable future offers much more than just survival. It paints a picture of a safer, more equal, stable world, demonstrating just how expansive the idea of a ""livable future"" could potentially be. It's a definition that can encompass the ideas put forward by Loach about joy and dignity, which include freedom from oppression that many around the world currently face.

There's so much hope to be found in the idea that our future generations may inhabit sustainable futures in which humanity has managed to renegotiate a more respectful, less extractive relationship with the Earth. Getting there requires urgent transformation on the part of governments and corporations, but citizens have an important role in fighting for this change and in welcoming it when it does arrive. If we let it, imagining a livable future can be a powerful motivator for embracing this change over maintaining the status quo.

As Loach writes in her book: ""To have active hope, we need to be able to envisage what it is that we are running towards, as well as running away from. We have to imagine what this new world will look like.""",https://www.cnet.com/science/climate/after-climate-change-what-does-a-livable-future-look-like/

Reduce, reuse, recycle. But please make sure you're doing it correctly

If you're trying to make your home more sustainable and reduce your environmental footprint, one of the first things you'll learn is to recycle. Recycling is an efficient way to manage the 139.6 million tons of waste that heads to US landfills every year. But it can be a helpful practice only if you actually do it right, which is sometimes not as easy as you may think.

Of course, start properly recycling all your waste that can be recycled.
But make sure you're recycling your plastics correctly.
And your paper and cardboard.
Next, focus on recycling those metal cans.
And learn which takeout containers are recyclable (and which aren't).
Once you've mastered recycling, you can move on to composting.

This story is part of CNET Zero, a series that chronicles the impact of climate change and explores what's being done about the problem.

Imagine the horrified looks you'd get if you dropped your paper coffee cup on the ground, stepped on it and walked away. A startup based in San Francisco and Germany says you can do exactly that with its cups, guilt-free.

GaeaStar is getting ready to introduce its 3D-printed, disposable clay cups to the US, after a successful trial period at coffee shops and ice cream parlors in Berlin. Watch the video above to learn more.

The cups are made from just three ingredients: dirt, salt and a small amount of water. Founder and CEO Sanjeev Mankotia told CNET he had the idea when he was visiting family in India and his cousin was drinking chai from a terracotta cup she bought from a street vendor. ""She drank the cup, and then smashed it on the ground. And I was like, 'You're throwing something away that's creating litter.' And her reaction was, ""It's made out of dirt, why is this an issue?""

GaeaStar cups are available at coffee shops and ice cream parlors in Berlin.

GaeaStar

Those terracotta cups, or ""Kuhlars"" have been used in South Asia for 5,000 years. They are typically never reused.

A 2016 study found that the US uses up to 50 billion disposable coffee cups every year. Whether they're made of paper, plastic or even a compostable material, most of those will end up in landfills. And even if they are recycled or composted, those processes require energy. 

Because GaeaStar's cups are made from just dirt, water and salt, the company says they leave no impact on the Earth.

Celso Bulgatti/Andy Altman

Mankotia said that because his 3D-printed cups are made from just dirt, salt and water, they can safely be left in landfills or even smashed to dust on the ground. ""When you throw it away, it's dirt again. So end to end, it comes from the earth and goes back to the earth."" (To be clear, he says he's not suggesting people leave shards of broken clay on sidewalks and streets.)

According to GaeaStar, it can print a ceramic cup using about 60% less energy than it takes to create a plastic or paper cup, for about the same price. ""When you scale it up, we feel that this could be priced in parallel or comparable to the incumbent cups in the market, if not cheaper.""

GaeaStar is launching its cups at Verve coffee shops in California this year.

GaeaStar

The company said the cups are 10 times stronger than paper cups, and it's banking on what it sees as an elevated customer experience. ""I call this the fine china experience with the convenience of disposability,"" Mankotia said.

GaeaStar's long-term goal is to put its patent-pending 3D-printers in shops around the US, where cups could be printed on-demand in about 10 seconds. Mankotia says dirt can be sourced locally to save energy. In the meantime, you'll be able to find them in select Verve Coffee shops around California this year.

California's Solar Incentives: What the Big Change Means for Homeowners

Under the new net billing systems, the daytime compensation for excess solar is about 75% less.

David Paul Morris/Getty Images
This story is part of CNET Zero, a series that chronicles the impact of climate change and explores what's being done about the problem.

A big change to how solar energy is measured in California just went into effect that may cause homeowners in the state to reassess the value of installing solar panels. 

Previously, whatever excess energy a photovoltaic system generated was fed back to the grid and the homeowner received a near dollar-for-dollar credit on their electricity bill. This is called ""net metering.""

But, as of April 15, any new rooftop setup will earn a much smaller credit for excess kilowatts. About 75% smaller, according to the California Solar and Storage Association, or CALSSA.

Best Solar Companies of 2023

The new system, known as ""net billing,"" is intended to get solar users to add a home battery backup system. Then, excess energy can be stored, rather than sent right back to the grid. Homeowners could then decide when to return the energy, getting a better return at night and in winter, when electricity rates are higher.

But CALSSA Executive Director Bernadette Del Chiaro warns that net billing will cast a shadow on California's solar market, the largest in the US. Under the old system, solar panels paid for themselves in about six years, Del Chiaro told San Diego's CBS 8. Under the new rules, she said, ""we are kicking that to 10 years or further.""

And the cost of a home battery -- more than $15,000 before installation, according to CNET's sister site SaveOnEnergy -- can be prohibitive. Currently, less than 10% of new solar buyers in the state get storage.

""For middle-class and working-class neighborhoods where solar is growing fastest, it puts clean energy further out of reach,"" Del Chiaro said in a statement.

Roger Lin, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity's energy justice division, said the new billing plan ""[widens] the divide between those who can afford solar and those who can't.""

The change affects customers of California's three largest investor-owned utilities: Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric. Combined, they service three-quarters of the state.

But only rooftop systems approved after April 15 are subject to net billing. Preexisting setups are grandfathered in.

Not everyone sees net billing as a catastrophe. Suzanne Leta, head of policy and strategy at residential solar company SunPower, said customers who combine a rooftop setup with a battery will enjoy more savings than they would with net metering.

Homeowners who don't have a battery will still save, Leta told CNET, ""it just won't be as robust.""

This story is part of CNET Zero, a series that chronicles the impact of climate change and explores what's being done about the problem.

Earth Day (April 22) is almost here, and this year I decided to mark the occasion by making small changes to my daily routine in an effort to live more sustainably. For starters, I decided to stop using disposable dryer sheets and made the switch to wool dryer balls. I figured it would be a tiny step in my journey toward living more sustainably, since the dryer balls are reusable, eco-friendly and can save energy by reducing drying time. However, since I live in the boonies, I had to turn to Amazon to make my purchase. And of course when my new wool dryer balls arrived in a giant cardboard box nestled in a sea of plastic, I felt a wave of guilt and anxiety wash over me. Would it be worth it in the long run? Yes, definitely. But it was a reminder that every time I make a purchase, it's important to consider the full life cycle of a product.

Trying to shop more sustainably is a worthy endeavor, but it can also be complicated and perplexing. Even when you buy items that are marketed as environmentally friendly, you're still purchasing new products, which means raw materials, water and energy were all used to create and ship them -- and that in itself can negatively impact the environment. Not only that, but in a world where corporations and governments are responsible for the majority of emissions, it's hard to know which brands to trust. More and more companies are guilty of greenwashing -- promoting false or misleading claims that they're environmentally friendly -- so it's important to do your research. 

Your best bet for sustainable shopping is to shop locally, shop used, and to reuse and repurpose old items instead of throwing them away. However, depending on your lifestyle, your budget and where you live, that's not always possible. To that end, we've rounded up a list of products that in one way or another can help you create a more sustainable home, and perhaps even minimize your ecological footprint in the long run. Whether you're looking to reduce waste, save energy or live a healthier lifestyle, these products aim to help you make small steps towards more sustainable living.

Baggu
Baggu Standard reusable bag

Most of us already have far too many reusable bags, but if you haven't made the switch yet from single-use disposable bags, we highly recommend Baggu's Standard bag. It's the perfect size for toting groceries, and it can hold up to 50 pounds. It folds up easily into a tiny square, and it comes in 25 colorful patterns, so you're sure to find a print you'll like. And did we mention that it's machine-washable?

Bento&co
Furoshiki wrapping cloths

When it comes to gift giving, presentation is almost as important as the gift itself. The problem is, not all gift wrapping is recyclable. Enter furoshiki, traditional Japanese wrapping cloths. The great thing about furoshiki is that, unlike wrapping paper, they can be used again and again. And the cloths come in so many gorgeous colors and patterns, it's almost like giving someone a second gift. You can find plenty of options online, but we're big fans of this double-sided wrapping cloth from Bento&co. The cloth is a beautiful, durable material, and the size works well for both small- and medium-size packages.

$7 at Bento&co
U-Konserve
U-Konserve Recycled Insulated Lunch Tote

This might be one of the most stylish reusable lunch totes we've come across. It's got a functional over-the-shoulder strip; it's not too bulky, but it's roomy enough for a lunch container, snacks, ice pack and a water bottle. It's made from recycled plastic bottles and is BPA- and phthalate-free. Plus, the insulated fabric lining helps keep food items cold or warm for hours -- great for bringing your own meals to the office or to school, especially if you've got kids who are past the Paw Patrol lunch box phase.

Smart Sheep
Smart Sheep Wool Dryer Balls

There are plenty of wool dryer balls out there to choose from, but I was drawn to these ""smiling sheep."" Not only are they ridiculously cute, but they get the job done. They've definitely cut down on drying time, especially when I need to dry towels or sheets. If you want to spend a little less, a six-pack of Smart Sheep's plain white dryer balls cost $17 on Amazon. Tip: I like to pair these with the essential oil lavender spray to give linens a light, refreshing scent.

$20 at Amazon
$35 at Walmart
Avocado
Avocado organic cotton sheets

These sheets aren't cheap, but they're ultra-breathable with a luxurious quality and feel. They're made with 100% GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) organic certified cotton from India, without the use of pesticides, herbicides or fertilizers. You'll sleep better knowing that your sheets are chemical-free, nontoxic and made from responsibly sourced materials. Prices start at $109 for the twin-size 400-thread count single ply weave. A standard queen set with a 600-thread count costs $229.

$229 at Avocado
Oxo
Oxo Good Grips reusable straws

As someone who enjoys my daily iced chai from Starbucks, these stainless steel straws were a worthwhile investment. They're an affordable and eco-friendly alternative to single-use plastic straws, and a whole lot better than the taste and feel of paper straws. Oxo's reusable straws are durable, lightweight, and have removable silicone tips for easy cleaning. The set comes with a small scrubbing brush -- a must if you want to thoroughly get that icky residue out.

Williams Sonoma
Silpat Nonstick Silicone Baking Mat

No need to use reams of parchment paper or aluminum foil in the kitchen. This reusable Silpat baking mat is made from a fiberglass mesh with a nonstick silicone surface, and it's an amazingly great eco-friendly product. It can survive in the oven over and over again, and will save you from having to grease your baking sheets. I use a Silpat on almost a daily basis in my kitchen, whether I'm baking cookies, roasting veggies or using it as a nonstick mat when I'm kneading dough.

$29 at Walmart
SodaStream
SodaStream Terra sparkling water maker

If you or a loved one likes to drink sparkling water, a SodaStream can be a smart investment. Not only can it help you cut costs, but it will reduce your usage of cans or single-use plastic, which is especially important considering how much recycling ends up in landfills. The SodaStream Terra is CNET's top pick for the best overall soda maker for most people, thanks to its easy-to-use manual pumps and space-saving design. (And, yes, you can ramp up the savings -- and the eco-friendliness -- by going with a different brand and using refillable CO2 tanks, but requires some DIY knowledge and effort.)

Girlfriend Collective
Girlfriend Collective compressive high-rise leggings

GM says the 2024 Chevrolet Equinox EV SUV will qualify for the full $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit.

GM
This story is part of CNET Zero, a series that chronicles the impact of climate change and explores what's being done about the problem.

The US Treasury Department has issued new guidance for the EV tax credit that will seriously curtail how many vehicles now qualify for the tax break, worth up to $7,500.

The credit was revamped by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which added income caps, price limits and other stipulations. Most changes took effect in January, but final details about battery components and ""critical minerals"" were still being nailed down when President Joe Biden signed the bill in August.

On March 31, the Treasury Department announced that 50% of a vehicle's battery must be assembled or manufactured in the US for it to qualify for up to $3,750 of the credit. That percentage ratchets up each year until it hits 100% in 2029. 

For a vehicle to qualify for the other $3,750 of the credit, 40%of the critical minerals in its battery -- like graphite, lithium and cobalt -- must be sourced from the US or one of the 20 countries the US has a free trade agreement with.

That amount will increase until 2027, when it maxes out at 80%. 

Chinese companies currently manufacture 56% of the EV batteries in the market. That puts the US at a competitive disadvantage and, according to the Biden administration, fuels geopolitical instability.

""The adoption of clean vehicles is central to reducing emissions in transportation while protecting Americans from the kind of spikes in gas prices that we saw at the outset of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's brutalization of Ukraine,"" Lily Batchelder, the Treasury's assistant secretary for tax policy, told reporters on March 23. ""However, we can't trade dependence on foreign oil for dependence on foreign batteries, and our forthcoming guidance will strengthen our supply chains.""

Starting next year, vehicles that contain battery parts from ""a foreign entity of concern"" -- a classification that includes China, Russia, Iran and North Korea -- will be unable to claim any of the credit. 

For critical minerals, the cutoff is 2025.

The new guidelines take effect on April 18, 2023, when the current tax season ends. The Treasury Department has yet to provide an updated list of approved EVs, but GM said Friday that at least three of its cars -- the Cadillac Lyriq and the new Chevrolet Equinox EV SUV and Blazer EV SUV -- already qualify for the full $7,500 credit.

Still, the auto industry has warned that only a fraction of the 91 electric vehicles on the US market today qualify for the full credit, and many won't be eligible for any tax break at all.

""This latest turn will further reduce the number of eligible EVs,"" John Bozzella, CEO of the trade organization Alliance of Automotive Innovation, wrote in a blog post on Friday. ""In fact, this period may go down as the highwater mark for EV tax credit eligibility since the IRA passed last year.""

West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin had pushed for the strict sourcing rules, even going so far as to threaten legislation to block the credit without them.  

Automakers and car dealers ""have to understand that is an energy security bill,"" Manchin, a Democrat, said in January, Roll Call reported. ""It was never designed to be just a climate bill, which is the way it's being promoted.""

Kelley Blue Book Executive Editor Brian Moody said the new guidance may temporarily limit how many models are approved, but ""at the core, the intentions are in the right place.""

""The policy is designed to get more EVs -- and the things that power them -- made in America,"" Moody told CNET. ""With more jobs for Americans and fewer for our adversaries.""

Foreign carmakers have anticipated the move, he added, and are broadening their US operations.

""It's already happening,"" Moody told CNET. ""Hyundai is building a $5.5 billion plant near Savannah, Georgia, that will include both an assembly plant and a battery factory."" 

Expected to produce 300,000 Hyundai, Genesis and Kia EVs a year starting in 2025, Metaplant America will be the largest economic development project in Georgia's history and a critical part of America's supply chain for batteries and other EV components. ",https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/new-rules-for-ev-tax-credit-make-most-vehicles-ineligible/

This story is part of CNET Zero, a series that chronicles the impact of climate change and explores what's being done about the problem.

When natural disasters strike, one of the first crucial resources that can get disrupted is electricity. Startup Sesame Solar thinks it's found a solution to providing power for emergency crews and displaced residents with its mobile Nanogrids.

At first glance, a Nanogrid may look like a food truck. It's designed to be hauled the same way you'd transport a moving trailer. But once deployed, the solar panels that line the Nanogrid are revealed. The panels charge the onboard batteries, and the company says a single Nanogrid can produce anywhere from 3 to 20 kilowatts. That's enough to power four to six houses.

Lauren Flanagan, Sesame's co-founder and CEO, calls the Nanogrid the world's first 100% renewably powered mobile system. ""You don't need fossil fuel. You don't need diesel or natural gas. Just water and sunshine,"" she said. Watch the video above to learn more about how the Nanogrids work.

One person can set up a Nanogrid in about 15 minutes.

Sesame Solar

In addition to solar power, the Nanogrids are equipped with a hydrogen fuel cell that turns water into hydrogen. The hydrogen can be stored in tanks and used to charge the batteries when they dip below 35%. Nanogrids also have an onboard water filtration system that can provide up to 500 liters of potable water per day, and a 5G mesh network so people displaced in a disaster can get online.

Taking Aim at Climate Injustice: US Focuses on Environmental Racism in 2023

Environmental racism is the idea that the climate crisis and damage from the fossil fuel industry affect Americans unequally. Under Biden, the US is finally promising to address the problem.

This story is part of CNET Zero, a series that chronicles the impact of climate change and explores what's being done about the problem.

""Cancer Alley"" is an 85-mile stretch of land in Louisiana containing 150 petrochemical facilities situated near mostly Black, low-income residents who suffer from abnormally high cancer rates. It's one of the starkest examples of environmental racism, or the disproportionate impact that pollution has had on minorities, particularly Black Americans. While the problem was recognized and named in the '80s, it's not until recent years that more attention has been given to this issue. Now the US is finally doing something about it. 

Environmental racism is another version of redlining -- practices that have discriminated against minorities seeking loans for better housing or even accessing higher internet speeds -- which is uniquely an American problem. While not new -- multiple studies have shown that historical redlining has created present-day air pollution disparities in US cities through the creation of environmental sacrifice zones -- the issue, as part of the broader push for climate justice, is finally gaining momentum.  

Even Beverly Wright, who grew up in Cancer Alley and is the founder of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, acknowledged she thought she knew about racism in all its forms before she learned about environmental racism. 

""It's a type of discrimination I could not fathom,"" Wright said in a panel discussion during the COP27 UN climate change conference in November. 

In 2021, decades after the problems in Cancer Alley were first identified, UN human rights experts were compelled to release a statement expressing their concern after further industrialization was planned in the region. ""This form of environmental racism poses serious and disproportionate threats to the enjoyment of several human rights of its largely African American residents,"" they said, noting it threatened the local residents' right to life, health and an adequate standard of living.

""Cancer Alley"" is one of the most polluted areas of the US.

The mission to acknowledge environmental racism hit a tipping point late last year, when President Joe Biden passed the Inflation Reduction Act, the most significant piece of climate legislation in US history. The bill channels billions of dollars into a clean energy future for the US, while benefiting jobs, industry and the country's economy. But it also included a $60 billion investment to address the unequal impacts of pollution and the climate crisis on marginalized communities.

This money and assistance is long overdue. For many Americans living in low-income communities and communities of color, it's already too late. Historic pollution from fossil fuel projects in the US has caused death and disease that has adversely affected these demographics for generations. These same communities are now bearing the brunt of the severe weather and disasters caused by the climate crisis on their homes and livelihoods.

Climate injustice is more usually associated with developing countries, many of which have done little to cause the crisis and yet are feeling its impacts most harshly. In reality, it's a global problem that exists wherever there are inequalities. But it's especially exaggerated in the US due to extreme wealth disparity, its legacy of colonization and racial segregation, the political clout of the fossil fuel lobby, as well as generations of denial about the creation of ""environmental sacrifice zones"" such as Cancer Alley.

Previous US presidents have acknowledged the problem, but Biden has been the first to center the climate injustice and environmental racism that have plagued low-income, Black and Indigenous communities for generations while making and enacting policy.

So far, this has largely been in the form of words and pledges, but the experts Biden has assembled on his White House Environmental Justice Council -- many of whom have been campaigning for decades on the issues -- are now waiting to see whether these promises will truly deliver for the most vulnerable and affected American communities. This coming year, as Biden enters the second half of his presidential term, will be the true test of his climate justice-focused policies.

""We're making these recommendations, we're voting on them, we're waiting to see whether they're going to be implemented,""  Ruth Santiago, a community and environmental attorney from Puerto Rico who serves on the council, said in a November interview during the COP27 UN conference on climate change.

For Wright, who serves alongside Santiago on the council, a Democrat administration making noise about tackling climate justice issues is nothing new. Under President Bill Clinton, she worked with federal agencies to make recommendations for tackling the problems, but she saw little to no action taken.

Now with Biden, she feels it's different. ""We've been able to make more radical recommendations, a number of them that we've seen move forward,"" she said in an interview. ""It's just more impactful.""

Resisting justice

Wright has seen first hand how government funding for environmental and climate disasters rarely reach Black communities. When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005, everyone she knew lost their homes. But when it came time to rebuild, white people were given more money than their homes were worth, and Black people were given less. It took a lawsuit for the state to amend the distribution of funding in a way that allowed Black people to rebuild.

Robert Bullard, who is known as the father of the environmental justice movement, said during COP27 that it was often the case that white communities ended up better off in the wake of extreme weather events, whereas Black communities became poorer. ""In many cases in the US and around the world, disaster hits, but often the second disaster is the way the government responds to communities,"" he said.

When seeking climate justice, litigation is often the only route open to activists protecting themselves and their communities. Speaking at COP27, former Vice President Al Gore told the story of how during the pandemic, he packed up his camper van and drove to Memphis, Tennessee, where he stopped in the empty Graceland parking lot to protest the Byhalia oil pipeline.

The plan was to snake the pipeline through Boxtown, a community in South Memphis whose residents were 97% Black and already suffered from the impact of pollution. 

""I called this a reckless racist rip-off,"" said Gore, who credits Bullard with inspiring his own environmental justice activism. ""It's reckless because it threatens the drinking water and the health of the community. It's racist because it's aimed at a minority black community. And it's a rip-off because this oil company gets the benefits, and all of the risk and all of the damage is put onto the people.""

The pipeline was eventually killed, Gore added -- not thanks to him but to the tireless work of the young Black activists within the community. But that wasn't where the story ended. Gore described how the oil companies subsequently lobbied the state legislature to pass a law preventing communities from blocking fossil fuel projects anywhere in Tennessee.

What happened in Tennessee is just one example of the resistance everyone in the US advocating for climate justice, from community organizers all the way up to the president, are up against. But if anyone doubts there is the motivation to keep resisting the money and power of the fossil fuel companies, Gore said, ""always remember political will is itself a renewable resource.""

Political momentum for change

Within fossil fuel lobby groups and the Republican party, there are many who oppose the idea of a just transition to clean energy in a way that prioritizes the health and prosperity of marginalized communities.

Few are more outspoken against these threats than Senators Ed Markey, Sheldon Whitehouse and Ben Cardin. Like the three musketeers for US climate justice, the senators used their attendance at COP27 in November to speak about the Inflation Reduction Act and many of the obstructions they've faced throughout their political careers to justice-centered climate action.

It's necessary for the US to express some ""humility"" over the fact that it took the country until August to pass meaningful climate legislation, said Cardin speaking at the summit. But, he added, climate justice is ""part of the DNA"" of the IRA and the bipartisan infrastructure bill, as well as being a principal objective across all domestic legislation introduced by Biden.

When Biden entered office, not only did he rejoin the Paris Agreement, but he signed an executive order laying out his intentions to prioritize tackling the issue, establishing the Justice40 Initiative to get money flowing into these communities. Then in September, he established the Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights, which will work under the Environmental Protection Agency to provide grants to communities suffering the effects of pollution.

These combined actions and initiatives represent a moment of reckoning for the US. After generations of sidelining and ignoring environmental racism and the climate injustices within its borders and territories, the country is now doing something.

""What changed was the voters threw out Trump and his pack of fossil fuel-funded climate deniers,"" Whitehouse told CNET at COP27. ""If you've got a fossil fuel-funded, climate-denying crew all around you, it's hard to take climate justice seriously or energy transition seriously.""

But even now, the three senators view the fight for climate justice as being far from over. The fossil fuel industry still runs ""extremely aggressive operations,"" including political countermeasures against climate progress in Congress through its control of the Republican party, Whitehouse said. To combat this, he wants to see the rest of corporate America begin to put its weight behind climate justice. If it does, he added, there is ""a whole second chapter"" to what Congress can achieve beyond the IRA.

Being in the room

The biggest challenge facing the US government right now as it pursues its mission to right the wrongs of historic environmental injustice is ensuring that the funding actually reaches the people it's intended for -- and that they get to decide how it's used. A frequent problem, highlighted by Bullard, is that affected communities are only further disenfranchised when the government dictates the solutions.

This is especially true when energy companies present solutions such as transitioning to nuclear energy to communities who have been historically impacted by nuclear power plants. Speaking at COP27, Janene Yazzie, a member of the Navajo Nation and Southwest regional director for indigenous empowerment organization NDN Collective, explained how these kinds of solutions are unacceptable to people in her community.

""I come from lands where our children are being born with uranium in their bodies because of the legacy of contamination,"" she said. Given the lack of technology available to clean up any nuclear damage that might occur, the community isn't willing to take this risk, she added. Instead, she called for solutions that stem from community rights that focus on well-being.

""The whole principle of environmental justice is that those who are most impacted must be in the rooms, must set the tone,"" Bullard said. ""Many solutions can come from the communities that are being impacted.""

Such a solution has been developed by local activists and academics in Puerto Rico. They developed a plan for transitioning the territory to decentralized rooftop solar based on the high-density development of the island, abundance of sunshine, and tendency for hurricanes to knock out and isolate communities from the centralized energy grid.  

""There's civil society consensus,"" said Santiago, who works as an attorney campaigning for the island's solar transition. ""We know what we need."" A study conducted by the US Department of Energy agreed, finding that Puerto Rico had four to six times the amount of rooftop solar potential compared with its energy demands.

But instead, what they're seeing, said Santiago, is an avalanche of projects from energy companies based outside of Puerto Rico wanting to build solar arrays on prime agricultural land -- threatening the territory's already vulnerable food security. Meanwhile, the US Federal Emergency Management Agency, which allocated the largest amount of funding in the agency's history to repair Puerto Rico's electrical infrastructure following 2017's deadly Hurricane Maria, wants to rebuild the same centralized grid system it had before.

A simple way for the government to prove its commitment to environmental justice and the climate crisis would be to fix the island's electrical system in line with the community's plans, Santiago said. ""The money is there, people want it, the rooftops are available,"" she said. ""Everything is in place, except the political will.""

As it stands, five years after Hurricane Maria, little of the promised FEMA money has come through and Puerto Rico's energy is still unstable. It's making Puerto Rican activists skeptical about federal funding pledges that claim to target affected communities.

""There's more discourse from the Biden government,"" said Federico Cintron Moscoso, Puerto Rico program manager for community human rights organization El Puente de Williamsburg. ""But how that materializes on the ground is what we haven't seen.""

Moscoso said that while speaking with other US community groups vulnerable to climate change at COP27, they shared many concerns about how far away the recent slew of climate justice policies felt from reality.

It's here at the grassroots across the US where local activists -- many from Black, Brown and indigenous communities -- are crying out for the funding being promised to them to enact the solutions they know will work for their communities.

""If we're serious about implementing climate solutions for all Americans, it starts by taking a rights-based approach to the development of those solutions, to understanding, protecting and upholding the rights of individuals, to building tables of decision making-power that bring all vulnerable people to that table,"" Yazzie said. ""That's how we will get to where we want to go.""

Smoke from the Hermit's Peak-Calf Canyon fire, as seen from Taos, New Mexico, on May 15.

Eric Mack
This story is part of CNET Zero, a series that chronicles the impact of climate change and explores what's being done about the problem.

I've lived in the high desert of the southwestern US most of my life, mostly in New Mexico and Colorado. In those four decades, I've never seen it as dry here as in 2022. In all that time, I've also never seen it as wet as in 2022. 

In northern New Mexico, the year began with months of unseasonal heat, dryness and extreme wind that fueled the largest wildfire of the year in the lower 48 states. It burned through 340,000 acres of the Sangre de Cristo mountains and destroyed or damaged over a thousand homes and other structures. 

Then, in the middle of June, the annual monsoon rains thankfully arrived to douse the fires. But they stayed a couple months longer and dumped nearly twice as much moisture as the previous year (or the year before that). In fact, we were still seeing some monsoon pattern precipitation several weeks later than normal.

There's a term for this remarkably rapid turnaround in weather patterns that an increasing number of scientists have begun to use, both in the mainstream media and academic publications: weather whiplash. 

""The huge shift in weather you experienced in New Mexico this summer is a perfect example,"" Jennifer Francis, acting deputy director at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Massachusetts tells me. 

Francis is lead author on a paper published in September in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres on measuring weather whiplash events, which can be loosely defined as abrupt swings in weather conditions from one extreme to another.

At my home in the high desert this year, those swings translated into a spring filled with smoke, heat, wind and the first emergency alert system notice I'd ever received warning me to get off the road immediately due to an approaching dust storm. By July the scene changed to one filled with rain, mud and more alerts, this time warning of flash flooding. 

""Weather patterns are getting 'stuck' in place more often, causing persistent heatwaves, drought, stormy periods, and even cold spells to happen more often,"" Francis explained via email. 

Her work shows all this stalled weather is connected to the rapid warming of the Arctic, which impacts the jet stream and in turn affects weather further south. 

""These stuck weather patterns sometimes come to an abrupt end by changing abruptly to a very different pattern. This is weather whiplash.""

The phrase has been increasingly used in climate science circles for the past several years, but Francis points to a number of other instances of the phenomenon on full, sobering display in 2022 alone. 

A July heatwave immediately followed exceptionally wet, cool weather in the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies in June. This turnaround was most dramatic in the Yellowstone region, where historic flooding in the first month of summer took many by surprise and claimed hundreds of homes but, somewhat miraculously, no lives. Shortly afterward, temperatures soared several degrees above average and the region dried out. 

Earlier in the year the inverse played out in Texas, where a spell of 67 consecutive dry, hot winter days in Dallas were followed by the city's heaviest rains in 100 years, leading to flash flooding and a declaration of disaster by the state's governor. 

Seasonal see-saw

From late March until early June, much of northern New Mexico saw no measurable precipitation for a stretch of more than 70 days. Even for the current era, which many scientists suspect is the beginning of a megadrought in the southwestern US, that's unusually dry.

This dryness, along with unseasonable heat and often extreme winds whipped up the embers of two controlled burns in the Santa Fe National Forest that had been secretly smoldering for months. Two wildfires sprang to life, eventually combining to form the 340,000-acre Calf Canyon-Hermit's Peak fire complex. 

The inferno burned homes, ranches, businesses and livestock, but didn't claim any human lives – at least, not directly. Tens of thousands were evacuated from nearby cities and villages for weeks as fire devoured some of the state's most rugged and beautiful terrain over the course of more than two months. 

I visited some of the impacted communities to witness the total disruption and devastation while waiting to see if the flames would continue to push closer to my own community near Taos, less than 20 miles from the northwest edge of the fire.

For weeks it looked as though a nuclear bomb had been detonated just over the ridge of mountains near my home. A pyrocumulus mushroom cloud of smoke from the fire reached up into the atmosphere, a constant reminder of impending doom one valley over. 

Sometimes the wind would shift and blow all that smoke our direction. It was possible to see this coming almost an hour in advance as a brown stream of smog would suddenly obscure the mountains. As it finally reached us, our eyes would water, our lungs would begin to burn and everything we wore or carried would take on the aroma of a barbecue. Minutes later, the sun would be blotted out on an otherwise sunny day. They were all sunny days back then. 

My family would retreat inside every time the smoke came, of course. Then, in early June, another fire ignited on the opposite side of our community from where the megablaze was burning.  We found ourselves surrounded. No matter which way the wind blew, there was a good chance it would blow smoke in our faces. 

At this point our daughter was quarantined at home with COVID. We faced the very apocalyptic choice of keeping the windows open for better antiviral ventilation or closing them to keep the smoke out. It wasn't a particularly hard choice. We closed the windows. Inhaling smoke certainly isn't great for getting over COVID, after all. 

Then, in mid-June, both the weather and its impact took dramatic turns. The annual monsoon rains arrived right on time, and with an unusual intensity. Ironically, this is how New Mexico's largest ever wildfire ended up claiming human lives after the flames had stopped spreading.

The 2022 monsoon in New Mexico was great for collecting rainwater, but came with downsides as well.

The burn scars left by wildfires absorb less moisture than healthy landscapes with plenty of vegetation, and that led to flash flooding. June and July in northern New Mexico saw repeated cycles of heavy rains, including a particularly heavy storm on July 21 that deluged the Calf Canyon-Hermit's Peak burn scar.  A flash flood tore through the Tecolote Canyon subdivision outside the city of Las Vegas, New Mexico, sweeping tons of mud, rocks, burned trees and even vehicles down the creek drainage. Tragically, three people were caught in the flood and died. 

In the span of weeks, citizens in New Mexico went from fleeing fires to fleeing floods. Whiplash might describe the disjointed nature of this past summer, but it doesn't begin to capture the anxiety brought on by this new realization that life in the 21st century might be about being ready for absolutely anything. 

In June I was hauling water to my off-grid home in the back of a truck, 200 gallons at a time, and praying for the monsoon to arrive. The following month I was digging trenches to divert as much water as possible out of my driveway to lessen the persistent rain's irritating habit of turning it into a muddy quagmire. This is to say nothing of the background anxiety created by nearby fires, floods and at least one epic wind event that took the roof off a neighbor's house. 

The climate connection

At least one group of researchers predicted this before it happened. Well, sort of. 

On April 1, just five days before that massive fire in New Mexico sprang to life, a paper was published in the journal Science Advances titled ""Climate change increases risk of extreme rainfall following wildfire in the western United States.""

The paper describes how scientists used climate models to predict that if global warming continues unabated, the western US will begin to see many more instances of extreme wildfires followed by extreme rainfall. They didn't wait  decades to see their predictions come true. It happened just weeks later. 

""I would qualify what happened in New Mexico as extreme precipitation following extreme wildfires,"" UCLA and National Center for Atmospheric Research climate scientist Daniel Swain, one of the authors of the study, told me. ""Some of those fires were literally still burning pretty vigorously when the rain started. You really can't get any whiplashier than that.""

The sun brought plenty of fire and rainbows to New Mexico in 2022. 

Johanna DeBiase

Swain is one of a number of climate scientists digging into the data to determine what is creating this new, very 21st century sort of see-saw. One of the main factors, he says, is that the warming of the planet is accelerating the water, or hydrologic, cycle that moves moisture from surface water to the atmosphere and back again via precipitation.

""You actually get an exponential increase in the water-vapor-holding capacity of the atmosphere,"" he explains. 

Basically, for every degree centigrade of warming, the atmosphere can hold 7% more moisture. These increases compound over time, sort of like interest in a bank account, which provides the exponential acceleration of extreme rainfall events that are more frequent and more intense. 

Swain describes our atmosphere as a sponge that grows ever larger as it warms, periodically soaking up potentially larger amounts of moisture and then dumping it all at once on some unfortunate locale. But this expanding sponge is also exacerbating dryness in places where it extracts an increasing amount of water out of the landscape. 

This means drier dry periods and wetter precipitation events, sometimes back-to-back. Whiplash. 

Swain cautions that it's too soon to know how much of the weather whiplash experienced in northern New Mexico this year can truly be blamed on climate change versus just basic bad luck and the natural variation and randomness that we'd see in our weather patterns even without global warming. 

Climate scientists have developed so-called ""weather attribution"" models that quantify the effects of climate change directly on specific weather events like what was experienced this year in New Mexico, but the process can take several months or longer. 

Weirder than warming

When I first started covering climate two decades ago, a climatologist told me that the phrase ""global warming"" wouldn't fully describe what was going to happen to our environment and that it would be more like ""global weirding.""

That phrase never caught on, but I'm starting to think weather whiplash might be its appropriate successor. 

For decades now, talk about the warming climate has focused on increasing temperatures, but usually these are increasing average temperatures. However, we don't experience climate in the aggregate. We live it day to day as weather that is increasingly extreme. 

""If you get 20 inches of rainfall distributed as half an inch a day for 40 days, it's a very different picture than getting 20 inches of rainfall because it rains 10 inches one day and 10 inches the next,"" Swain suggests. ""The average might be the same, but you're living in a completely different world.""

In other words, our experience of climate change can't be fully captured by talking about how much temperatures or sea levels or rainfall are rising. It's the extremes and the weirdness and the chaotic swings from one state to another that tell the real story and inflict the most trauma. 

At the point this summer when wildfires were burning on both sides of our community, I had a weird flashback to my childhood. One of my favorite things to read as a kid in the previous century was Choose Your Own Adventure books. They had this intoxicating ability to provide both an escape and agency at the same time. 

It feels like we could use a little more of both things right now. Life today has the feel of all the potential adventures in those books happening back to back and often simultaneously. The only choice is to be ready for anything.

Women weren't underrepresented at COP27, but were underrepresented in positions of power.

Katie Collins/CNET
This story is part of CNET Zero, a series that chronicles the impact of climate change and explores what's being done about the problem.

There was nothing to make the ""family photo"" featuring the heads of state visiting the COP27 climate summit held in Egypt last month especially remarkable. It was hardly obvious fodder for a viral internet moment. 

And yet the picture gained considerable attention on the internet based on the only notable thing about it: being overwhelmingly male.

If you only saw this viral photo, you might assume women had been excluded from COP27 entirely. ""At this point, maybe we should ask women for help,"" tweeted climate scientist David Ho alongside the image. He's not wrong. 

The UN acknowledged the damaging effect of the overrepresentation of men in negotiations, as did the COP27 presidency, as did many men and the majority of women at the conference. And yet consistently women are still underrepresented at the highest levels of leadership.

While the lack of women in high-ranking positions is not solely a climate problem, it's a problem that hurts our ability to solve the climate crisis. Speaking at COP27, UN Women Executive Director Sima Bahous said women's leadership is essential to get the world back on track to achieving its sustainable development goals.

""This basic truth is demonstrated time and again,"" she said. ""Countries with more women in leadership, in the labor force, in peacemaking and more do better.""

Increasingly, we're all feeling the effects of the climate crisis through more frequent and intense weather events, but women – and especially those from vulnerable countries at the intersection of multiple inequalities – feel them worse than men. A report released by the UNFCCC at the Bonn Climate Conference this June detailed the ways in which climate-related events can result in more gender-based violence. Often this is due to migration putting women and children at risk, and poverty forcing girls to marry early or drop out of school.

Women in many parts of the world also have very few rights over land, in spite of being the ones with most knowledge of local ecosystems, and doing the most to protect those ecosystems. ""We all know women are stewards of our planet, be it on peace or climate change, while also often being on the frontline of climate impacts,"" Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, said in an email.

With an entire day dedicated to gender at the climate talks, there was no shortage of recognition at COP27 that women are feeling more of the pain from the climate crisis or that they lack a voice. But the solutions put forward rarely lead to any shift in power dynamics.

At last year's COP26, young women accused the summit of youthwashing after inviting them to speak in front of world leaders, but excluding them entirely from negotiations. A similar pattern has emerged this year. Young women have been invited to address world leaders and negotiators, but are absent when it comes to decision making. The constant toll of being wheeled out to urge the people in charge to do their jobs properly has become grating for some.

""We are constantly being invited, we give lots of speeches, we do lots of interviews, but now we want our leaders to take action,"" Vanessa Nakate, a Ugandan activist for climate group Fridays For Future, said at COP27. ""Many times we've been told we're inspiring, that we inspire our leaders to take action, but now we don't want to inspire them, we want our leaders to inspire us.""

At the grassroots level, women show leadership by using their knowledge and experience of working the land, fetching water, cooking and heating homes to develop solutions. But that leadership doesn't scale up. At higher levels, this knowledge is often treated as yet another thing to be taken from them, rather than a reason to put them in positions of power.

Where are the women?

This year at COP27, there was no lack of smart, wise women. They demonstrated their leadership within their communities, on panels, in protests and among their peers. But they remain underrepresented in negotiations. 

Yurshell Rodríguez, an activist from Colombia, said she's happy to see the leadership of Black and Indigenous women within the community, but representation at higher levels isn't enough. ""We don't want to just represent,"" she said. ""We want to be part of the talk, we want to be part of the negotiation, and understanding what is going on.""

According to official UN figures, 40% of registered COP participants this year were female, although when it comes to party delegates – those brought along by countries to be part of their official team – that figure drops to 33%. This means women are more likely to have observer status, coming to the talks with NGOs or other third parties but remaining outside the rooms where decisions are made.

""We need to see many more women in leadership,"" said Andersen. She echoed the words of UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who has said that male-dominated teams lead to a male-dominated culture. 

Women came together at COP27 to demand gender-just climate solutions.

Katie Collins/CNET

""I for one am tired of male-dominated solutions,"" she said. Putting women at the heart of environmental decision making is ""critical,"" she added.

At the top level of COP leadership, there is actually one less woman than last year at COP26 in Glasgow. Patricia Espinosa stepped down as head of the UNFCCC organizing body between summits, and was replaced by a man. Even last year when she looked at the family photo and saw herself in it, she was struck by the lack of women, she said in an interview at the beginning of this year's summit.

""Look, this is not the picture of what the world should look like in the 21st century,"" she said. ""And there is such clear evidence that not including women at that level is not good for societies, for the world, for economic and social development, for peace, for stability.""

Women's rights at risk

For many women, including those who have been working on climate issues for many years, it's not obvious how people secure a seat at the table. ""Are we even in the queue?"" said Beverly Wright, who founded the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice at Dillard University back in 1992. As an African American woman, she sees this struggle taking place at every level.

In light of the recent overturning of Roe v. Wade in the US, Wright is concerned that ""a breakdown of norms"" may even be forcing women backward, and she's not alone. During a panel discussion in the second week of COP27 at the Climate Justice Pavilion, Eufemia Campos Cullamat, a former member of the Philippines' House of Representatives, described how it was becoming increasingly difficult for women to play a role in fighting the climate crisis due to attacks on Indigenous women and their associations.

Espinosa, meanwhile, was part of the Mexican national delegation that negotiated the Beijing Declaration – a UN resolution regarding women's equality – back in 1995. She wonders whether today it would have been approved.

""We are looking at backsliding on women's rights and gender equality in some places, and that is very concerning,"" she said. ""We should really defend what has been a big, big, big fight for women.""

Women bringing solutions

Everywhere at COP27 outside of the negotiating room, the value of women's leadership is clear. Women, and Indigenous women in particular, are doing much of the work to protect the environment, while getting their hands dirty with solutions.

""We should probably talk more about women as solution providers, as really a group in society that solves issues on an everyday basis on different fronts at different levels,"" said Espinosa.

Rodríguez is a perfect example of this. She has been involved in beach cleaning, mangrove planting and coral restoration projects since the age of 10, after losing her home on the island of Providencia to a hurricane. Later, in 2018, she was part of a group of 25 young people who sued the Colombian government to stop deforestation in the Amazon rainforest and won.

Women working in climate often have little choice but to default to being the agitators and activists. It's left to them to hold male leadership to account for their failings, and in doing so improve the planet for everyone.

At the opening event of the US Center (the country's national pavilion) during the first week of COP27, it was only after John Kerry, John Podesta and Michael Bloomberg had left the stage that women were invited to speak. While the men talked up the Biden administration's work to improve US climate policy, it was left to 20-year-old climate activist Sophia Kianni to call out the fact that a few days after COP26, Biden launched auctions for more than 80 million acres for oil and gas extraction off the coast of Mexico.

Several women I spoke to at COP27 felt that women played a more protective and proactive role than men when taking climate action. ""In Indigenous communities, we always talk about how the Earth is female, and how the healing of the Earth comes from mothering, from nurturing,"" said Rodríguez. ""That's the way I feel and I think about the healing process we need to go through with our planet right now. She needs nurturing.""

Ukraine's Hope for a Green Future Burns Bright Amid Environmental Devastation

Ukraine came to COP27 bearing its scars from Russia's war, but also imagining its green future.

Russia's war has devastated Ukraine's built and natural environments.

This story is part of CNET Zero, a series that chronicles the impact of climate change and explores what's being done about the problem.

Next door in the Australian pavilion, chipper baristas serve the best flat whites in town, while across the way at the Brazil booth, splashes of yellow, blue and green mingle hypnotically across digital displays. But at Ukraine's pavilion, all is dark and somber.

This is the first year that Ukraine has had its own country pavilion at the UN's climate summit, COP27, which is taking place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, this week. The space functions as a visual metaphor for the current state of the country, with gray slanting walls, a tree trunk studded with bullets, and a tall cylindrical space featuring samples of damaged soil from all over Ukraine -- a tomb for the country's lost and damaged biodiversity.

Over the past two weeks, tears have been shed here, including those of Ukraine's Minister of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, Ruslan Strilets, as he welcomed a crowd of reporters into the small space on Monday evening. ""This pavilion is a place of unity for all friends of Ukraine,"" he said, a single tear sliding down his cheek.

He seemed taken aback by the turnout, with at least 50 people crowding into the small booth, but there's been no shortage of solidarity for Ukraine at this summit. Russia's war has not only caused death and devastation within the country, it's also sparked a global energy crisis that's caused the cost of living to shoot up all over the world.

Likewise, the destruction of nature in Ukraine -- or anywhere else for that matter -- is a problem for all of us. As Strilets put it: ""The environment has no border."" Nature is one of our most powerful allies in the battle to minimize the worst effects of the climate crisis. It sucks out of the atmosphere all of the carbon we've pumped into it over the years, helping to provide some relief to our rapidly warming world. Destruction of biodiversity and natural habitats sets the collective race back, and in Ukraine, the devastation has been extensive.

""The environment is always the victim of conflict,"" said Inger Andersen, head of the United Nations Environment Programme, who's been involved in analyzing the environmental damage of several wars. ""Conflict leaves a toxic legacy that is carried by generations,"" she added, while speaking at the launch event of Ukraine's global platform for assessing environmental damage caused by military action.

At the launch, Strilets presented a summary of what has happened in his country. Russia's war in Ukraine is still ongoing, but in the past eight months since Russia invaded, the conflict has already caused 2,239 recorded cases of environmental damage and placed a fifth of Ukraine's protected areas under threat.

Forests in the country have been especially hard hit, as they've been heavily occupied by the Russian military and see the heaviest fighting, with many suffering fires. Around 450,000 hectares of forest lie within occupied or hostile zones, with 63 separate forestries under occupation. ""The Russians have turned our natural resources into military bases,"" said Strilets.

When it comes to biodiversity, around 600 animal species are under threat, and 750 species of plants and fungi, according to government calculations. Since the end of February there have been 120 cases of dolphins being killed in the Ukrainian part of the Black Sea.

This year, Ukraine is on track to exceed its 2021 emissions due to the pollution caused by the Russian military. While the rest of the world is discussing weaning itself off fossil fuels, Ukraine is once again forced to discuss the fight against pollution, Strilets said.

A brighter, greener future for Ukraine

It wasn't supposed to be this way. Before Russia's invasion, Ukraine was preparing to formally apply for EU membership, and as part of this preparation, it was planning to align itself fully with EU green directives. But the war has thrown its plans for a green transition way off course.

Now, with his eyes fixed on the future, Strilets foresees a ""unique opportunity"" to rebuild Ukraine as a green country that generates and subsists on renewable energy. Featured at the Ukrainian Pavilion at COP27 were several exhibits detailing how the country will become a green leader. A printed message from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy read: ""Ukraine can, and I am certain will, become a green energy hub for Europe.""

Models of wind turbines were accompanied by a caption explaining the country's plan to generate 30GW annually of renewable energy by 2030 (it already produces 13GW per year) and export 15 of those gigawatts to Europe. It's about more than just rebuilding, said the caption said, it's about creating something new that will make Ukraine an important part of the EU's energy security.

""Ukraine should march from the ashes of this war as a climate-neutral society,"" said Natalia Andrusevych, chair of the board of directors of the Resource & Analysis Center, speaking via Zoom at the event. Andrusevych has written a policy brief on postwar reconstruction that models sustainable development for Ukraine.

Making Russia pay

This green reconstruction will be astronomically expensive. Ukraine has calculated the environmental damage the Russian military has already caused at more than $39 billion. Speaking over Zoom at the event, Alanna Simpson, lead disaster risk management specialist from the World Bank, said that taking into account the damage done only until June 1, around $349 billion would be needed for recovery and reconstruction.

This bill isn't just for simply rebuilding what's been lost, it's about ensuring Ukraine is well set up for the future. ""We don't want to rebuild a 1960s school to 1960s standards,"" said Simpson. Instead, she added, it must be green.

To pay for it, Strilets, Andrusevych and many others from Ukraine are talking about seeking reparations not only from Russia, but also from the fossil fuel companies that are profiting from the conflict. Russia ""aims to turn the entire planet into a bomb shelter,"" said Strilets, and should be held accountable not just by Ukraine, but by the whole world for the environmental damage it's causing.

This is a central part of the work the grassroots activist organization Razom We Stand is currently undertaking, said activist and lawyer Svitlana Romanko. She and many other Ukrainians, including those who are displaced or are refugees, have come to COP27 this year because they believe that not enough people understand that the money Russia continues to earn from fossil fuels is financing the war in their country. ""Both supply and demand side for the fossil fuel industry need to be seriously cut off,"" said Romanko.

Their presence at the conference has brought them face-to-face with members of the Russian delegation and fossil fuel executives, which has left them feeling deeply angry and disrespected. Last week, Romanko confronted Patrick Pouyanné, the CEO of French energy company Total -- which Razom We Stand is currently trying to sue. She asked him whether he'll use the blood money he's made through Russia's war to finance Ukraine's reconstruction. ""Probably,"" he told her in response, patting her arm in a way she said felt ""patronizing.""

Total didn't respond to a request for further comment.

Romanko's hope is that any money recouped from oil companies and from Russia is used to help Ukraine decarbonize while rebuilding, spurring the country's development and making it safe, secure and self-sufficient for generations to come. ""We don't want that cheap, dirty money to rebuild business as usual,"" she said. ""We want to create a precedent where that money is used for the green transition.""

There are plans in the works to take advantage of greener construction methods and to rebuild in the style of the New European Bauhaus initiative, which brings people from different disciplines together to create sustainable, affordable and accessible buildings.

""We want to be the great powerful example for how to rebuild,"" said Romanko. She envisions a Ukraine that runs on ""community-owned distributed green energy that does not kill,"" and where people can wake up in the morning, look out of their windows and not see explosions, but a safe, green country.

Ukraine has spent nine months under constant bombardment from the Russian military, and is now facing the long, hard, cold winter ahead. In spite of this, Romanko, Strilets and the many other Ukrainians have joined the ranks of those fighting the climate crisis at COP27 and are refusing to let die their vision of a future that's free of fossil fuels. ""Peace and freedom,"" said Romanko. ""That's what drives us.""

At COP27, Historic Deal Will Compensate Poor Nations for Climate Crisis Disasters

A win for vulnerable countries was offset by weak ambition in the final agreement to take necessary steps to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Loss and damage has been the defining issue of COP27.

Katie Collins/CNET
This story is part of CNET Zero, a series that chronicles the impact of climate change and explores what's being done about the problem.

Developing countries, climate NGOs and activists celebrated a victory more than 30 years in the making on Sunday, as they welcomed the news that this year's UN climate summit, COP27, has resulted in the establishment of a funding mechanism for loss and damage. 

It marks an important breakthrough in multilateral climate negotiations that will see countries that are historically responsible for emitting the majority of greenhouse gases compensate those from vulnerable countries, who are the hardest hit. For something that many activists argue is long overdue, it can't come soon enough.

""The announcement offers hope to vulnerable communities all over the world who are fighting for their survival from climate stress,"" tweeted Sherry Rehman, the minister for climate change from Pakistan -- the country that's been leading the call for a loss and damage fund on behalf of the G77 countries and China at COP27. Pakistan has suffered from intense flooding this year that's killed more than 1,700 people and displaced over 2 million more. 

But the outcome of COP27 wasn't a resounding success. In particular, many involved in the COP process were surprised and frustrated that the text countries adopted didn't mention phasing down or phasing out fossil fuels. Climate talks often end this way -- with some wins and some losses, but the lack of focus on limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by transitioning away from fossil fuels to renewables is something many working on climate action consider a massive loss.

""Our planet is still in the emergency room,"" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said in a speech following the close of COP27. ""We need to drastically reduce emissions now -- and this is an issue this COP did not address. A fund for loss and damage is essential -- but it's not an answer if the climate crisis washes a small island state off the map -- or turns an entire African country to desert.""

COP27 has been running for the past two weeks, starting Nov. 7, in Sharm el-Sheikh, a resort town on Egypt's Sinai peninsula. Alongside the core negotiations, there's been a whole program of events, with numerous protests and visits from heads of state thrown into the mix. The summit was set to close Friday, but it ran over as COPs usually do, dragging negotiations out into the weekend. After a tense day of negotiations on Saturday, which included a threat from the EU that it might walk away from the talks, parties managed to reach agreement on issues in the early hours of Sunday morning, while the dawn call to prayer echoed across Egypt. 

With people all over the world increasingly struggling to handle the fallout of extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change, the need to establish ways to mitigate the effects of the crisis, adapt to protect against further harms and provide relief to those suffering its worst effects has only become more urgent. Many people, activists in particular, feel UN summits are ineffective forums for building consensus and taking action on climate, due to the glacial pace of change. But the climate talks remain important, as they're the only chance all countries have to gather in a room and decide how to jointly tackle the climate crisis, a problem that knows no borders.

The theme of this year's summit was ""the implementation COP,"" which meant putting into action what had been agreed in Glasgow at COP26 last year, after the interim period had seen very little of what was promised there come to fruition. But on Friday, when the summit was set to close, negotiators were once again rehashing the same issues as in previous years, leading Greenpeace Southeast Asia Executive Director Yeb Saño to say it felt more like ""the repetition COP.""

The Egyptian climate talks were beset with problems, which ranged from practical issues around lack of food and drink at the event site, overcrowded transportation, and sewage running through the venue, to procedural issues that delayed negotiations. In the middle of the second week, Guterres flew back to Egypt from the G20 summit in Bali to urge parties to rise to the occasion and work together in spite of what he identified as a breakdown in trust between developed and developing nations.

""The world is watching and has a simple message: stand and deliver,"" he said in a speech Thursday. ""Deliver the kind of meaningful climate action that people and planet so desperately need.""

Loss and damage

Securing a fund for loss and damage has been the defining issue of the summit. It was such a priority for vulnerable countries and activists, that many said they'd consider COP27 a failure if agreement on a funding facility wasn't established.

For the first time after more than 30 years of activist campaigning, the issue made it onto the COP27 agenda this year. But even though financing garnered support from the G77+China and the EU, the contentious nature of compensation meant that this was one of two negotiating points that caused the negotiations to run late. 

The US, the world's largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases, has been particularly concerned about making itself liable, leading it to resist the creation of a fund. It showed more willingness to talk about loss and damage at COP27 than in the past, but wanted to shift the responsibility away from governments, which it said would only be able to contribute billions, to industry, which would be able to cough up the trillions truly required.

In the end, the countries were able to reach agree that a fund should be established, which was seen as a win for climate justice -- the movement to make the world safer, greener and more equal and fair. Saño described it as ""a victory for people power.""

""The agreement for a Loss and Damage Finance Facility marks a new dawn for climate justice,"" he said in a statement. ""Governments have laid the cornerstone of a long overdue new fund to deliver vital support to vulnerable countries and communities that are already being devastated by the accelerating climate crisis.""

There is still anger from some corners that it took so long for governments in the developed world to acknowledge the importance of loss and damage and stood in the way of progress. ""The EU should be ashamed of itself for blocking it for so long,"" said Wiktoria Jędroszkowiak, a Polish activist from youth organization Fridays for Future. ""This COP wasn't ambitious -- it was a fight to secure agreements that are still leading us towards the ongoing climate disasters.""

Fossil fuels

Securing funding for loss and damage is going to be more necessary than ever if the climate crisis continues to gather pace. Critics of the final deal argued that this would be the case due to the lack of focus on actually trying to reduce emissions by weaning ourselves off fossil fuels.

The language around phasing out fossil fuels was the other issue that held up the negotiations this year. Scientists and climate experts have consistently argued that the only way to keep global warming to within a 1.5 degree Celsius limit is to phase out all fossil fuels entirely, including coal, oil and gas. But some countries have resisted such rapid and all-encompassing decarbonization, leading to a tussle over how fossil fuel phaseout should be written in.

In the end, the language was excluded entirely.

""While the long-delayed progress on loss and damage is an important breakthrough, the latest draft of the cover text completely fails to address the fossil fuels that are driving the climate crisis and the escalating losses it is causing,"" Carroll Muffett, president and CEO of the Center for International Environmental Law, said in a statement.

Muffett also expressed her frustration that parties were told to update their nationally determined contributions, or NDCs, which say how each country would meet its commitments under the Paris Agreement without being told to increase their ambition and tackle the root causes of the climate crisis. She was one of a chorus of voices deeply frustrated at the lack of focus on fossil fuels and renewables.

""There is no time left for incremental change, every fraction of a degree matters,"" May Boeve, executive director of 350.org, said in a statement. ""We needed radical implementation of measures to keep to 1.5 degrees Celsius and avoid the worst ravages of climate chaos, we needed a swift, just and equitable phaseout of fossil fuels. We didn't get that at COP this year.""

In the absence of fossil fuels from the deal this year, some civil society members and activists are taking heart from the fact that the transition to renewable energy is already underway around the world. Already they're looking to next year's summit, which will take place in the United Arab Emirates, to advance this transition further and will likely be lobbying for this to be front and center on the 2023 agenda.

""The COP28 climate summit next year must be the COP of climate credibility,"" Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, COP20 president and WWF global climate and energy lead, said in a statement. ""And countries must deliver.""

The Joint European Torus is a fusion reactor with the doughnut-shaped tokamak design.

JET
This story is part of CNET Zero, a series that chronicles the impact of climate change and explores what's being done about the problem.

By this time next decade, you could be reading this story on a phone charged by fusion power, the same energy source that fires the sun.

There's no guarantee that future will arrive on time or at all. Fusion reactions have proved notoriously difficult for humans to sustain, despite some companies trying since the 1990s. But a recent surge in technology improvements and investment has delivered steady progress -- and optimism the environmentally friendly technology is within reach.

If successful, it could supply humanity with the kind of abundant, clean power that attendees of the United Nations' COP27 climate change conference dream about. Although fusion isn't likely to reach large scale soon enough to fix the world's climate problems, it could still prove essential to satisfying humanity's appetite for power in future decades.

""This looks like something that we're starting to get within striking distance,"" said Andrew Sowder, a senior technical executive at the Electric Power Research Institute, an energy research and development nonprofit. ""What we have seen is something going from just a strictly national lab, government-sponsored effort to the private sector, driven by deadlines and with real innovation.""

Fusion energy occurs when lighter atoms, most often hydrogen, combine into heavier ones like helium. It's hard to marshal the forces to smash the atoms together, but the reaction releases a tremendous amount of energy: A pickup truck's worth of fusion fuel has the same energy as 10 million barrels of oil.

The appeal is clear. Unlike burning coal, oil or natural gas, fusion doesn't release carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas that's the main driver of climate change. Fusion also is free of the long-lived radioactive waste or catastrophic meltdown risks that are problems for today's nuclear power plants.

Adding new electrical energy sources is critical with energy demand increasing in coming decades thanks to changes like the shift to electric vehicles and dramatically expanded use of air conditioners. The United Nations' International Energy Agency forecasts that by 2050, electrical energy use will increase between 75% and 150% over today's levels, with the higher level required to reach more aggressive reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. By 2030, the agency said, the planet will need as much new power as is now used in the US and Europe.

Our energy demands and the world's climate problems have triggered new business activity. Entrepreneurs have launched 21 new fusion energy startups since 2017, according to the Fusion Industry Association, with nearly 60% of the total $4.8 billion raised by fusion startups occurring in the last year.

The Biden administration, a fusion proponent, said in November that fusion energy is one of five key approaches to halve carbon emissions by 2030 and reach net zero emissions by 2050. The Energy Department has earmarked $50 million to help private sector fusion projects.

The benefit of fusion energy is clear. The hard part will be actually making it work.

What exactly is fusion?

The idea of fusion has been around for decades, with scientists a century ago starting to understand how it powered the sun, first fusing atoms in 1933 in a lab, and figuring out how fusion can power thermonuclear weapons in the 1950s.

Fusion is the process of jamming atoms from lighter elements together to form a different, heavier element. It takes a lot of energy to combine the lighter elements. But the act of combination pays you back with energy much greater than what's put in. Harnessing that energy is the basis of a fusion reactor.

Matter on Earth is typically found as a solid, liquid or gas, but the temperatures required for fusion are high enough that matter transforms into a fourth state called a plasma. Atoms in a plasma are so energetic that the nucleus at the heart of each loses its electrons. Because particles in plasma are therefore electrically charged, they can be manipulated with electric and magnetic fields.

Fusion is the opposite of fission, the reaction that powers nuclear power reactors today. There, the nucleus of a heavy element like uranium splits into lighter elements and releases energy. Another difference: When fusion reactors have problems, they just fizzle into idleness, with no comparable risk to the meltdowns that afflicted Chernobyl and Fukushima fission plants.

Most fusion startups are working on combining two forms of hydrogen called deuterium and tritium, a blend known as D-T fuel for short. Hydrogen is the lightest element, and most hydrogen atoms have just a single proton in their nucleus. Deuterium has a neutron tucked in there too, and tritium has two neutrons.

When the deuterium and tritium combine, they form a helium nucleus and a lone neutron. The neutron rockets away, propelled by the extra energy of the fusion reaction. The energy output is tens of millions times greater than in combustion of the molecules in fossil fuels.

In most fusion reactors, a ""blanket"" of molten metal or salt surrounding the fusion chamber captures the kinetic energy of the fast-moving neutrons, heating up in the process. That heat can then boil water to drive a conventional steam turbine to generate power.

It's hard to start a fusion reaction because the positively charged nuclei repel. In the sun, there's enough pressure from gravity to squeeze the nuclei together anyway. It fuses hydrogen at the astounding rate of 620 million metric tons per second, generating enough heat to feel toasty when you bathe in the sun's rays 93 million miles away.

In earthbound fusion reactors, other means are necessary to squeeze the plasma until it reaches temperatures of 100 million degrees Celsius (180 million degrees Fahrenheit). That's where today's engineers are hard at work. Various combinations of magnetic fields, electric currents and lasers confine hydrogen in a high-temperature plasma form in devices with exotic names like tokamaks, stellarators and z-pinch machines.

Some developments now making their way into the fusion business include superconducting materials that carry huge electrical currents at relatively high temperatures, artificial intelligence technology to oversee reactions and 3D printing to make unusually shaped reactor components.

Tokamaks: Fusion in a high-tech hollow doughnut 

The leading design is a tokamak, which uses powerful magnetic fields to trigger fusion inside a doughnut-shaped chamber -- a torus, to use the technical term. The name tokamak comes from Soviet scientists who invented the design in the 1950s and 1960s.

Arguably, the leading startup pursuing tokamak fusion is Commonwealth Fusion Systems, a spinoff from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It had a big 2021, first demonstrating new electromagnet technology that generated the world's strongest magnetic field in September, then raising an eye-popping $1.8 billion in funding in November. 

""The reason we think that tokamaks are great is that there's been so much scientific validation of the concept,"" said Brandon Sorbom, Commonwealth's co-founder and chief science officer. ""We wanted to have the least amount of science risk as possible.""

The company is spending its money on a massive new tokamak called Sparc and has begun building a facility to house it at a new site in Devens, Massachusetts, about 25 miles west of Boston. The goal is to start operating Sparc in 2025 then take it beyond a critical threshold where the reactor produces more energy than it consumes as soon as possible.

Commonwealth Fusion Systems has begun building its Sparc fusion reactor at a site in Devens, Massachusetts.

Commonwealth Fusion Systems

That net energy threshold, called breakeven, is only a first step. According to plans that Commonwealth detailed in a septet of peer-reviewed scientific papers about Sparc, the reactor could produce energy output 10 times its input. That means the fusion gain factor, denoted by the letter Q in scientific circles, is 10. Commonwealth hopes to cross that threshold within two or so years of Sparc's first operation.

In the world of fusion reactors, you'll see a lot of talk about pushing Q as high as possible. The current fusion energy record, set in 2021 at the Joint European Torus in the UK, produced about 11 megawatts of power but only at a Q factor of 0.33.

After Sparc, Commonwealth plans to build another test reactor called Arc that's designed to actually generate power and attach to the electrical grid. It's planned for the early 2030s and should generate about 400 megawatts of power, enough to power tens of thousands of homes. For comparison, a typical nuclear power plant produces about 2.5 times that much, a gigawatt.

Next come the real machines, each generating about the same power as Arc and embodying Commonwealth's very high hopes.

""To make a dent in climate change, the plan is to build on the order of 10,000 of these by 2050,"" Sorbom said.

Superconducting magnets shrink tokamak designs

The key breakthrough for Commonwealth was high-temperature superconductors, materials that can carry huge electrical currents if cooled enough. High-temperature superconductors, a class of materials developed in the 1980s and beyond, don't need to be chilled as much as the conventional superconductors discovered decades earlier.

Superconductors enable very high magnetic fields designed to confine the plasma fuel and trigger fusion. And crucially, it makes that possible with a much smaller fusion reactor than, for example, the multinational ITER fusion reactor that's been under construction in France for years, with years more work to go.

One problem with D-T fusion is obtaining the materials. Deuterium is found naturally and can be filtered from ordinary water, but because tritium is radioactive, it decays away over a few years. Commonwealth and many other fusion reactor companies deal with this by including some lithium, another lightweight element, in the energy-capturing blanket surrounding the reactor. Incoming neutrons smash into the lithium and transmute some of it into tritium, a process called breeding.

One tokamak challenge is that engineers need to get the blanket hot while also keeping the hulking D-shaped superconducting magnets cold. Sparc will have a powerful chilling system and will operate in shorter pulses to control magnet heating.

Another tokamak difficulty is that those high-energy neutrons cause problems, smashing some atoms apart and glomming onto others. That makes for structural problems and some radioactive materials, particularly on the ""first wall"" of material nearest the plasma.

To deal with that, tokamaks are designed with some replaceable parts. But rebuilding the interior of a tokamak means significant downtime.

Z pinches and other fusion alternatives

Several other approaches besides tokamaks are in development, including Type One Energy's ""stellarators"" that look like contorted tokamaks, First Light Fusion's projectile fusion and EX-Fusion's laser zapper system.

That variety is one reason that EPRI's Sowder, a self-described ""skeptical optimist,"" is relatively bullish on fusion. Fusion researchers are taking ""multiple shots on goal,"" he said. ""All it takes is one or two of those to succeed.""

Zap Energy, based just north of Seattle and expanding to 100 employees this year, hopes to score with an approach called the Z pinch that uses a tubular fusion chamber small enough to fit into a pickup truck bed. Zap's fusion technique uses a pulse of electrical current that creates the plasma and squeezes it from a diffuse column into a thin line that's stable and dense enough to fuse. No superconducting magnets are needed.

Zap's newest reactor, Fuze-Q, is designed to reach that important Q equals 1 threshold where the reactor produces net energy. That could happen as soon as 2023 if research goes well, Chief Executive Benj Conway said, though cautioning ""fusion is a graveyard littered with overpromises."" After that, Zap plans to double electrical current and increase energy output tenfold.

""It's not inconceivable that we can have a first ever clean power plant at the end of this decade,"" Conway said.

General Fusion, based in Vancouver, Canada, uses steam-powered pistons to compress plasma that's magnetically confined within a whirling cylinder of molten metal blanket. It plans to begin construction of a demonstration reactor next year and turn it on in 2026.

General Fusion uses pistons to compress a plasma until a fusion reaction begins.

General Fusion

""We're looking at our first commercial power plant in the early 2030s,"" said Mike Donaldson, a General Fusion engineering vice president.

TAE Technologies, founded in 1998 and thus one of the granddaddies of fusion commercialization, has raised more than $1 billion in investments so far, most recently from Chevron (which also invested in Zap) and Google (which also invested in Commonwealth).

Its field reversed configuration design spins plasma in a loop like a tokamak, but does away with much of the toroidal machinery. To keep the plasma loop spinning, TAE gooses it with beams of hydrogen atoms. TAE's sixth-generation ""Copernicus"" machine is designed to produce net energy in the next two and a half years or so, said CEO Michl Binderbauer.

Next comes ""Da Vinci,"" a prototype due in the early 2030s designed to pump power onto the electrical grid. This machine also should reach a whopping 1 billion degrees, a temperature that would let the company move from D-T fuel to a combination of hydrogen and relatively heavy boron, called p-B11. That's harder, but doesn't produce any neutrons or resulting radioactivity complications, Binderbauer said.

Fusion must compete with wind, solar

Fusion startups are racing not just against each other but also the proven clean energy options of solar and wind power.

One of the most powerful reasons wind and solar have done well is the industrial phenomenon called Wright's Law, also known as the learning curve or experience curve. It's a World War II-era observation that manufacturing improvements bring down costs as capacity doubles. It's the reason why solar power costs dropped 90% from 2009 to 2021 and wind costs dropped 72% over the same period, according to annual tracking from advisory firm Lazard.

Wright's Law applies chiefly to items produced in high volume, so it's not yet clear how well complicated fusion plants will benefit.

Fusion fans are aware of the issue, though. TAE explicitly chose a design that could be mostly assembled in a central factory and shipped out in a 40-foot container. ""We believe we can actually get this down in price,"" Binderbauer said.

TAE Technologies' ""Norman"" fusion reactor is named after company co-founder Norman Rostoker.

TAE Technologies

In any event, fusion could complement renewable resources. Solar and wind power are intermittent, and today battery storage to store up power for peak demand moments also is expensive at large scale. In contrast, fusion could be a good ""baseload"" power source, supplying energy around the clock the way coal and nuclear plants do today. 

Fusion arriving late to the climate party

Although fusion energy has been a dream for decades, today's climate problems have given it new importance. You shouldn't count on cheap, abundant, clean fusion power as our savior, though.

Even if the first commercial fusion plants arrive in the 2030s, it'll likely be years before they supply a significant percentage of power. The later they arrive, the less role they can play in dropping the planet's net carbon emissions to zero by 2050.

Even some fusion fans see it that way.

""In the best case, let's say in the US, you could get to maybe 10% of the energy mix within 20 years. You've really got to forget 2050 targets,"" Zap's Conway said. ""This idea that fusion is going to solve climate change as we know it...is just not true."" 

Even so, fusion could prove important to civilization. New power sources could make it easier to wean energy-hungry industrial processes like aluminum smelting, fertilizer production and water desalinization from fossil fuel power plants. It could even potentially power direct air capture plants that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

""If humans are going to become an advanced civilization,"" Conway said, ""fusion is one of those gateways that we have to pass through.""

Diatoms, a group of phytoplankton, are hardy organisms that might be thriving under sea ice in Antarctica

This story is part of CNET Zero, a series that chronicles the impact of climate change and explores what's being done about the problem.

Winters in the frigid depths of Antarctica are desolate. The sun disappears for months on end, and the continent becomes surrounded by a ring of sea ice, extending out into the Southern Ocean. But even these extreme conditions, scientists are learning, are no match for life. 

In a new study, published Thursday in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science, scientists suggest one of the most critical organisms in the Antarctic food web — microscopic phytoplankton like algae and bacteria — are thriving underneath sea ice.

Many different species of phytoplankton are photosynthetic: They require sunlight to generate energy. When the ocean freezes over, less light can penetrate to the surface where they typically thrive. Scientists have been studying when and where the tiny organisms begin to flourish and have noted this typically occurs when the sea ice retreats. In recent years, work at the opposite end of the world, in the Arctic, has suggested masses of phytoplankton (or ""blooms"") can and do survive under sea ice in darker, low light conditions.

The same may be true in Antarctica. 

In the study, scientists collected data from 51 floating laboratories (""floats"") deployed between 2014 and 2021. The floats can gather biogeochemical signals across the Southern Ocean with a suite of sensors and they can also detect sea ice and dive below the surface, drifting through the water.

Looking at the amount of chlorophyll molecules detected by the floats and comparing with NASA satellite determinations of sea ice cover, the researchers described plentiful blooms of phytoplankton living below the sea ice, typically before it retreats during the polar summer. This was true for about 26% of the measurements made.

This, they note, could signal there is a whole hidden ecosystem lurking there that has typically not been accounted for. And if the phytoplankton, which form the basis of the food web, are hiding out under the ice, then we may be underestimating the amount of life hiding out there.

""The more we seem to look under Antarctic sea and land ice the more we seem to find,"" said Christopher Horvat, a polar oceanographer at Brown University and the University of Auckland and first author of the study.

Are there ecosystems hidden beneath Antarctic ice?

Jackson Ryan/CNET

However, Horvat notes, the floats do not provide exact locations when sea ice is present. Instead, they broadcast positions when they return to the surface, leaving some uncertainty in whether the blooms happen underneath or in more open areas of the ocean.

The natural question, perhaps, is what happens to these blooms as climate change sees sea ice retreating earlier and earlier. It's too early to tell, in the Antarctic, but some earlier research in the Arctic is beginning to suggest human-driven warming could affect blooms under sea ice in the north.

""To know if these populations are resilient to climate change we need to know if these events are new or if they were happening before, how often they happen, which species are blooming, understand the physiology of these species and what are the physic-chemical conditions that allow these blooms to form,"" said Antonia Cristi, a marine ecologist at New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research.

Future research using different under-ice data collection methods or year-round ship deployment could determine exactly where the phytoplankton blooms are occurring and how much of this is happening under the sea ice. It wouldn't be unexpected to find life adapted to some of the most extreme conditions on Earth — previous finds show we've barely scratched the surface. 

For instance, in 2021, the British Antarctic Survey drilled a hole in the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf and found unusual lifeforms at a depth of around 4,000 feet. And this past June, New Zealand scientists working at another ice shelf, Ross, melted a hole and found a river of life lurking beneath the shelf, some 1,600 feet down.

Yes, Jurassic Parks fans. Life does indeed find a way. Even in the dark, cold seas of Antarctica.

Chargrilled ""chicken"" was pleasingly tender.

Good Meat
This story is part of CNET Zero, a series that chronicles the impact of climate change and explores what's being done about the problem.

Dinner is served at the Four Seasons in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, and tonight we're having chicken – but with a twist.

Unlike all other chicken I've eaten before, this chicken was grown in a lab in Singapore from meat cells and shipped for a handful of lucky participants at the UN's COP27 climate summit, which is happening this week. Made by California-based Good Meat, this is version three of the cultivated chicken that's hopefully going to help save the planet.

We've reached a stage in history where the majority of people acknowledge the science of human-instigated climate change and actively want to help – but ideally, most people want to do that without fundamentally changing what they eat.

""We don't like to talk about meat in the same way we like to talk about fossil fuels,"" said Good Meat founder Josh Tetrick as he welcomed us to our al fresco dinner. It's true that meat can be a tricky subject to broach, even in climate circles. The vegans protesting outside of COP27 every day go largely ignored as everyone files past to work out how to solve the climate crisis by literally any other means possible.

And yet as a global population, reducing our meat consumption is something we need to consider, especially in Europe and North America, if we are to make vital reductions in the emission of greenhouse gases – production of meat is a hefty contributor. There are three ways we can do this, said Tetrick. We can ask people to eat less meat, ask them to eat more plant-based products or make real meat without harming animals. This third option was listed as a recommendation in April's report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 

Cultured meat is having something of a moment, with lab-grown chicken receiving FDA approval for the first time on Wednesday. At COP27, alternative proteins have been ""on the menu in a big way,"" said Bruce Friedrich, president and founder of the Good Food Institute. It's a trend he hopes will continue now that food is finally being discussed in the context of the climate crisis. ""In order to truly meet our global climate goals, we need to address how meat is made,"" he said.

This is exactly what Tetrick and his team are doing in their Bay Area lab, and out in Singapore – the first place they can legally sell their products. Their goal? Make cultivated meat so good you'll want to buy it instead of meat from slaughtered animals.

In order to perfect Good Meat products – starting with chicken, but with beef, pork and fish in the works – Tetrick has brought on board chefs, people who care deeply about food, in order to make something people will love. This feels like the recognition of something important: that food choices are tied up not just with the simple matter of liking and disliking different foods, but in culture, tradition and emotion. ""The meat thing is pretty personal,"" he said.

This evening, we'll all have our own personal experiences with Good Meat's meat and the chance to consider whether, given the choice, we might buy this instead of the endless packs of chicken breasts we tend to reach for at the grocery store.

Getting up close and personal with cultivated chicken

Really, the best tester for lab-grown meat I can think of is my husband, who is more carnivore than omnivore and struggles to recognize the legitimacy of a meal that doesn't include animal protein. Unfortunately, he is not in Egypt and I am. That means the task falls to me to answer the question of whether Good Meat's cultivated chicken is convincing to the point where he would consider choosing it over the ""real"" thing.

First things first, Good Meat isn't pretending this chicken is a replacement for the whole bird he'd whack in the oven for his signature Sunday roast (although when I raise the possibility of such a thing with Head of Product and chef Chris Jones he gets very excited about trying to re-create chicken on that bone). For that we'll need to continue buying a high-welfare chicken from our local butcher.

Instead, version three of Good Meat's chicken is a direct replacement for the kind we tend to cook with at home at least three times per week – breast or thigh meat that we can pop in curry or pasta or a stir fry. And I'm pretty convinced it passes the test.

Chicken skewers were served with locally sourced ingredients.

Good Meat

The first course we're served involves a chicken kebab that balances just above the lentil and tomato soup it accompanies. This has been done purposefully so that we can taste the meat on its own at first and get a true impression of what it's like.

Similarly, the third course is a simple piece of grilled chicken resting on top of aromatic rice, soy-glazed mushrooms, broccoli, chili curls and sesame seeds. We gather around to watch it cooking over coals, the char lines forming on the flesh, before we sit down to tuck in. The chicken certainly tastes like the real deal – much better than the processed chicken products you can buy right now in stores. There's a tenderness to it. If I hadn't known it was grown in a lab, I might not have picked up on it at all.

It's brave of Good Meat not to gussy it up with seasoning and sauces, but Tetrick doesn't seem interested in tricking people. He knows his chicken is a work in progress, involving endless fine-tuning to satisfy both the poultry-hungry people of the world, his fastidious on-staff chefs and himself – the boy from meat-loving Birmingham, Alabama.

As someone who has eaten various meat alternatives – Quorn and its friends – on and off for years, I'm personally ecstatic this product exists. But Good Meat wants honest, detailed feedback about what it can improve upon, so I channel my meat connoisseur husband and try to think what he would say. 

Right now, the fibrous texture is still lacking. I think it also needs to be juicier and springier. Instead of bouncing back a little when you sink your teeth into it, it collapses too easily under pressure. Obviously, no one likes tough or rubbery chicken, but it's lacking some resistance.

I've left the best until last, though. Perhaps my favorite dish of the day is dish two of our three-course tasting menu, which features crispy chicken skin. Tetrick admits that he has been snaffling it from the kitchen, and I can understand why. It's substantive and has the buttery, fatty taste you want from chicken skin. I can't imagine a more perfect pub snack with a cold pint of beer.

Unfortunately, living in the UK means I won't be able to buy Good Meat's chicken skin in my local grocery store anytime soon. The company doesn't have immediate plans to expand there. After Singapore, the next big markets Good Meat wants its products to be available in are the US, China and the Middle East. The EU will likely be last due its strict regulatory environment.

In the meantime, Good Meat's chicken will keep iterating. Tetrick knows full acceptance of his product by mainstream society is a ways off. Young people are more open to the idea of cultivated meat, he said. ""Genetically engineered,"" are the words he hears most often from people resisting it. 

People have doubts and hangups because it's so new, but that won't be the case forever. ""I hope one day no one thinks to ask the questions about this,"" he said.

The Egyptian resort town Sharm el-Sheikh, which plays host to the UN's COP27 summit on the environment, is now the epicenter of the fight for climate justice. But on Saturday, the midpoint of the two-week conference, protests erupted in cities around the world, from London to Washington, as activists joined the cry for more to be done.

The Global Day of Action is supposed to be a sprawling protest to advocate for everything from loss and damage financing to kicking fossil fuel reps out of climate talks. But at COP27, activists instead found themselves hemmed inside the grounds of the conference center. The short march of several hundred people made a tight circle around the venue, before gathering in one of the limited larger outdoor spaces to hear from activists representing different continents and causes following an Indigenous blessing.

The scene provided a stark contrast to last year's Global Day of Action at COP26, when activists were joined by people from across the UK to take part in an epic march that totaled around 100,000 people across the entire city of Glasgow, before gathering in a city park for a rally that stretched as far as the eye could see. 

The wide disparity underscores the tenuous fine line that protesters need to walk at COP27, given the host country's mixed attitude toward freedom of speech. Activists are an important presence at the summit, providing grassroots perspectives on the impacts of climate change. Collectively, they stand together as the climate justice movement – protesting not only for an end to fossil fuels, but for a fairer, more equitable world. This includes calling out human rights abuses committed by polluting companies and governments while they pursue energy projects. But the activists' limited ability to protest at the summit has cast a harsh spotlight on this critical tie between fighting for human rights and fighting to save the planet.

As a result, crowds like those that appeared last year weren't possible here at COP27 due to security restrictions preventing protests on the streets of Sharm el-Sheikh, said Asad Rehman, director of the anti-poverty charity War on Want. ""We came here knowing that we were not going to be in our thousands, but those that are here are united and raising our voices together,"" he said.

The lack of representation comes at a time when more voices are trying to make themselves heard as climate change's broad impact begins to materialize in different ways for different regions. 

""We're seeing here that civil society space has shrunk, and it's a deliberate way to suppress the voices of the people in the most marginalized groups,"" said Mitzi Jonelle Tan, a Fridays For Future MAPA activist from the Philippines. (MAPA stands for ""most affected people and areas."") ""How can we claim to have a successful climate conference without the voices of the people who are most impacted by the climate crisis?""

Mitzi Jonelle Tan helped lead the Global Day of Action protest at COP27.

There has been widespread debate among observers and participants about whether the focus on human rights at COP27 is distracting from the main task of the summit, which is to implement climate action. But speaking at an event at the summit, Tirana Hassan, acting executive director at Human Rights Watch, reminded the audience that human rights are enshrined in the climate-focused Paris Agreement for a reason: to ensure solutions put forward don't violate the rights of vulnerable people. 

""The climate crisis itself is one that compounds existing inequalities,"" she said. ""When governments restrict particular human rights and freedoms of expression, assembly and association, that makes it very difficult for climate activists to be able to do their jobs.""

People working across the spectrum of environmental policy credit the tireless work of activists for shifting the needle on many core issues that are now integral to the climate agenda. At COP and at other climate talks, they are viewed as an essential and valuable asset, calling out greenwashing, demanding transparency, campaigning for justice for those who are most impacted by climate change and elevating the voices of those on the front lines of the crisis.

It is in large part thanks to the work of activists, some of whom have been working for more than 30 years on the issue, that the subject of ""loss and damage"" has finally made it onto the agenda this year. Loss and damage lies at the intersection of human rights and climate action. It's a term used to describe compensating people who are already experiencing the worst impacts of climate change despite living in the countries that have contributed the least to the crisis.

""Our demands are clear,"" said Tan. ""We need a loss and damage finance facility for climate reparations. That's all we're asking for basically – a world where we feel safe, a world where no one has to be afraid. Why are we being punished for that?""

COP27: A safe space to speak

The smaller, more claustrophobic march that took place on Saturday has been emblematic of activist activity at COP27.  All protests at the summit have been distinctly muted in comparison to those that took place at COP26. There's a chance that even if you're attending COP27, you might not have seen any at all.

Activists at the summit told CNET that they're too fearful to protest anywhere outside of the ""Blue Zone"" – the secure venue in which the official summit takes place – due to potential reprisals. Many Egyptian environmental activists are languishing in prison, and activists who have come to the summit to represent the climate justice movement are wary of surveillance. ""What we can speak here, we can't speak outside of these walls of this conference,"" said Rehman.

Wiktoria Jędroszkowiak, a Fridays For Future activist from Poland who traveled with a group of young Eastern European activists, including some from Ukraine, said they were filmed on their flight from Istanbul to Sharm-el-Sheikh and at the airport by someone waving a Russian ID in their faces. Some of the group have already been searched by security. Other activists I spoke to were wary of being targeted for their LGBTQ+ identities, which aren't well tolerated in Egypt.

Activists felt safe protesting inside the COP27 venue.

The Egyptian COP leadership has set aside a fenced-off area of land on the edge of the desert that activists can apply to hold protests in, although it did not respond for a request for comment when asked about the exact address, whether it would be possible to visit or how many people had made use of the space so far. 

Activists I spoke to are wary of being penned in by Egyptian police – better sticking to the neutral ground of the Blue Zone, where the only security to contend with is provided by the UN. ""It's a bit safer for me because of the security and everybody around, so there's no cause for alarm,"" said Goodness Dickson, who protested in the Blue Zone for loss and damage on Thursday.

On Thursdays, we wear white

There is no strict dress code at a UN climate summit. From tailored suits to Indigenous dress to T-shirts and sandals, anything goes – especially when the summit is held on the edge of the Egyptian desert.

But on Thursday, a significant proportion of the attendees at the climate talks turned up to the venue wearing white – an intentional, coordinated decision that represented a show of solidarity with Egypt's political prisoners – of which there are thousands.

The first couple days of COP27 saw nothing in the way of protests. But the arrival of Sanaa Seif, sister of Egypt's most famous political prisoner, Alaa Abdel-Fattah, on Tuesday set something in motion. 

Abdel-Fattah, sentenced to five years in prison for sharing a Facebook post, has been on a long-term hunger strike, and ceased drinking water since the beginning of COP27. He is still alive due to medical intervention, but would otherwise now be dead – a PR disaster for COP that Egypt can ill afford.

An Egyptian lawmaker accosted Seif during a press conference and had to be removed by UN security. Later that day, at an event hosted at the German Pavilion with Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, Seif said she was glad there was space to talk about her brother and human rights at COP.

""I'm really heartened by the solidarity, and that's what's keeping me together,"" she said. ""Regardless of the repercussions afterwards, I think what happened here was ultimately a good thing.""

Sanaa Seif spoke out for her brother at COP27.

Seemingly buoyed by Seif's bravery in addressing the elephant in the room, activists have increasingly protested inside the Blue Zone for Abdel-Fattah – often throwing off layers at the end of events to reveal ""Free Alaa"" T-shirts. This year, along with the cries of ""What do we want? Climate justice! When do we want it? Now!"" is a different call: ""Free Alaa! Free them all!"" 

Addressing the press conference incident with reporters, Egyptian Ambassador Wael Aboulmagd said it's ""definitely the theme around the COP that people can speak their mind and make any statements they wish to make.""

That may be the case during COP27, but Egyptians who have taken the opportunity to speak up know that goodwill may not last. Under President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, the ability to speak out has become increasingly restricted, said Hossam Bahgat, the founder of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, speaking at the German Pavilion event. He detailed how people have been targeted for expressing opinions on social media, how many websites are blocked in the country and how media outlets have increasingly been silenced. ""Egypt was never a liberal democracy,"" he said. ""But we had a fighting chance, we had room for resistance.""

In the past few years, it's become too difficult for human rights activists to try to help communities suffering the consequences of environmental damage caused by power plants or military projects, he added. Any visits by human rights defenders to these communities will be swiftly followed by visits from the police who will arrest local citizens as payback.

During the event, people wearing host country badges filmed Bahgat as he spoke, took photos of the protesters wearing ""Free Alaa"" T-shirts and attempted to mount a counterprotest. He knows he's putting himself at risk – that after the global media and dignitaries have departed, he may suffer the consequences of speaking out.

""It is something that is currently on every Egyptian activist's mind,"" he said. But when it was announced that COP27 would come to Egypt, it seemed like too good an opportunity to pass up to speak out with the whole world listening, he added. 

Bahgat is subject to a travel ban that prevents him from leaving Egypt, meaning he rarely has an opportunity to speak on the international stage, or even a local one (his organization is not allowed to hold press conferences in Cairo). ""The mountain came to Mohammed,"" he said.

There are many, including Secretary General of Amnesty International Agnès Callamard, who feel that COP should not be held in countries such as Egypt and the United Arab Emirates (the location of COP28) where people do not enjoy the freedom to protest and where there are track records of human rights violations.

""In an environment where there is no transparency, no predictability, where there is no access to information, no freedom of the press, what kind of effective climate policy can you have?"" she said, also speaking at the German Pavilion event. ""There is no critique, there is no dissent.""

But while COP27 is in Egypt, she too is determined to use the opportunity to campaign for change. ""We are making what we can out of it here, we will do the same in the UAE,"" she said. ""So that's a message to them: release your political prisoners now. You have one year.""

Solidarity at the ""African COP""

Ultimately, Bahgat is grateful that COP27 came to Egypt. ""We needed the attention, we needed the solidarity,"" he said. ""I don't think that UN summits should only go to the democratic countries, UN summits should go to anywhere where civil society and activists need to be heard.""

And they are being heard. World leaders visiting COP over the past year have taken up Abdel-Fattah's cause, both calling publicly for his release and speaking directly about the issue with El-Sisi – but to no avail. He's also been widely supported by climate justice activists across the world, both before and during COP, even though they also know they're still putting themselves at risk. 

""Tax the rich"": Activists want reparations from wealthy countries.

Katie Collins/CNET

Those who have protested reported being told by UN security inside the Blue Zone to remove ""Free Alaa"" T-shirts before exiting the venue and to leave banners behind in case they were spotted or searched by Egyptian police. 

Finding the guts to stand up and speak out in spite of the risks is something Shamim Wasii Nyanda from Tanzania knows all too well. She has been reprimanded several times in her own country for protesting environmental justice issues, but still she feels a responsibility to do it. 

""There are so many activists out there who cannot stand out and speak, because they're very much scared,"" she said. ""And because I have the platform and the opportunity, and the people who can help me echo that voice, then I take advantage of that opportunity.""

It's been especially difficult for African activists to represent themselves at COP27 due to a mix of human rights and logistical barriers preventing their attendance, which Rehman described a ""huge disappointment."" ""This should have been an Egyptian COP, it should have been an African COP,"" he said.

High prices have prevented many African activists from attending COP27.

Katie Collins/CNET

Standing on a ledge at the rally on Saturday and addressing the crowd, Nigerian activist Nnimmo Bassey echoed these sentiments. ""This is not an African COP because the COP is lost and damaged,"" he said, referring to the widespread belief among activists that the UN process for tackling the climate crisis is a broken system. Africa has been historically robbed and polluted and is still being assaulted by oil, gas and mining companies, he said, as people hollered and cheered in support.

Next to him, Seif, who had been front and center in the march through the Blue Zone, stood visibly trembling. Rehman read out a statement on her behalf, in which she thanked the climate justice movement for lifting up her voice and saying that after COP she would return to Cairo to join her mother, who waits daily at the gates of the prison hoping for news of Abdel-Fattah. 

""Your actions have turned the slogan, 'There is no climate justice without human rights' into a reality,"" said Rehman, reading her words. ""One day, I hope my brother will be able to stand here with you and raise his voice as he has always done for the repressed, the criminalized, the marginalized and the ignored.""

Climate Change Denial Makes an Untimely Comeback

The science about the climate crisis is unequivocal, but a recent report shows a rise in misinformation about the topic.

Science attributes the climate crisis to emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.

This story is part of CNET Zero, a series that chronicles the impact of climate change and explores what's being done about the problem.

When researchers set out to study the effects of disinformation on global populations, they discovered something surprising: a huge resurgence in climate denial in 2022.

In the past year, climate science has been clearer than ever. Three recent reports from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have warned that we must make urgent changes. If not, we are on a ""highway to hell,"" as UN Secretary General António Guterres said last week. At the same time, there has has been an uptick in those refusing to believe what the evidence is spelling out.

For as long as scientists have been warning us about climate change, there have been people denying the problem exists. But in the face of mounting scientific proof and real-world impacts, denialism had become a fringe viewpoint. That changed in 2022, Jennie King, a representative from the Institute of Strategic Dialogue, told reporters on Tuesday at the UN COP27 climate summit after releasing a report about the impacts of climate disinformation on public perception. 

""We are now seeing out-and-out denial is making an absolute comeback,"" she said.

Zooey Liao/CNET

The increase in climate denialism can be linked to a wider embrace of conspiracy theories that includes false ideas about everything from Russia's war in Ukraine to the COVID-19 vaccines. Misinformation around politics and the widely debunked notion of election fraud have sowed mistrust in democracy in the US. That willingness to ignore facts and science has meant more audiences are receptive to dismissing the notion of a climate crisis. 

""It's not necessarily because there's a direct climate link, it's more because it's an opportunity to piggyback on news cycle events and to make sure that those ideas are laundered into the mainstream and become normalized for the mainstream audience,"" King said.

It's terrible timing for the future of humanity. This week, as policymakers gather in Egypt for COP27 to collaborate on the urgent challenge of fighting the climate crisis, they are embracing all the scientific evidence out there that shows humans have caused changes to the planet through the emissions of greenhouse gases. People from vulnerable countries have brought to the conference stories about the impact of the climate crisis they're seeing at home, which include an increase in the frequency and intensity of devastating weather events resulting in loss of livelihoods and lives, or displacing them and their communities.

But there are many forces out there seeking to undermine the scientific facts using lobbying, advertising and disinformation campaigns -- either for political reasons or to delay our transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy for profit. And their efforts are taking hold.

Tuesday's report, released by the Climate Action Against Disinformation and Conscious Advertising Network, was based on a YouGov survey conducted across six countries: the US, the UK, India, Brazil. Australia and Germany. It examined public perception of a number of disproven climate myths, as well as denialism. 

In the US, 46% of survey respondents said they thought climate change was not caused by human activity, and 23% said that they believed climate change is a hoax made up by the World Economic Forum. Roughly a quarter of Americans surveyed believe that the country can't afford to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and that the world in fact doesn't need to decarbonize and achieve net zero at all to ensure the future welfare and prosperity of humans.

Another finding of the survey showed that many people believe that the global cost-of-living crisis is caused by their government's net-zero policies, rather than high global energy prices due to Russia's war in Ukraine. Even though renewable energy's cost is competitive with energy from fossil fuels, and projections suggest significant, continued damage to the global economy if we don't transition away from fossil fuels, some also believe that their countries can't afford to make the change.

This shows a massive disconnect between the reality of the climate crisis, which is already exerting huge pressure on governments, economies and people around the world, and many people's understanding of what is happening. There is widespread agreement not only among scientists, but economists, governments, industry and others, that reaching net zero is critical for limiting planetary temperatures from rising past 1.5 degrees Celsius. To allow warming to exceed this limit will have far-reaching consequences, including making many areas of the Earth uninhabitable and causing mass migration, leading to instability and conflict.

Disinformation is at the root of many false beliefs about climate, and there are ""perverse incentives"" for its creation, said Harriet Kingaby from ACT Climate Labs and the Conscious Advertising Network. Much of it originates from lobby groups from big associations that act as a front for multiple fossil fuel companies, added King. Sometimes they will have as many as 850 ads running on a given day, which together achieve tens of millions of impressions that aim to confuse the public about viable solutions to the climate crisis. 

Tech companies need to step up

As a result of the survey, leading climate experts and major advertisers on Tuesday called upon tech companies, along with the UN and presidency of the COP27 climate summit, to tackle the growing problem of disinformation. In an open letter, they addressed the CEOs of Facebook, Instagram, Google, Twitter, TikTok, Pinterest and Reddit asking them:

To accept a universal definition of climate mis/disinformation that encompasses the misrepresentation of scientific evidence and the promotion of false solutions.
To produce and publicize a plan to tackle climate mis/disinformation on platforms, while advertising their zero-tolerance policy to the public.
To not publish any ads that include climate mis/disinformation.
To share internal research on the spread of climate mis/disinformation on their platforms.

All companies named in the letter have been contacted for comment.

Amplification is a major problem that platforms need to tackle, said King. If tech companies are willing to look at the systemic issues with the architecture of their platforms they are more likely to be identify the small number of verified accounts responsible for the spread of most climate disinformation and limit them, rather than playing content moderation Whack-A-Mole with hundreds of thousands of data points. 

""We're not talking about censorship of free speech, but we're talking about not giving them the biggest megaphone that has ever existed in the history of mankind,"" she said.

Some platforms, including Google and Pinterest, have already taken great strides to put climate disinformation policies in place, said Kingaby. But other platforms such as Twitter, which is going through the biggest upheaval in its history with the arrival of new owner and CEO Elon Musk, are more likely to struggle to keep a handle on disinformation.

Twitter's content moderation policies have not yet been updated, said Jake Dubbins from the Conscious Advertising Network. But the departures of many leaders in trust and safety and sustainability parts of the company are likely to have a knock-on impact on the enforcement of those policies, he added. ""There are lots of groups testing and pushing the boundaries because of the free speech narratives coming from Twitter,"" he said.

The damage done by warping people's perception of the science is more than just a simple difference of opinions. In a February report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the authors identified misleading information about the scientific reality of the climate crisis as a barrier to climate action, and having ""negative implications for climate policy.""

""Climate mis- and disinformation are a huge threat to everything that we are trying to achieve here today at this conference,"" said Kingaby. ""We must get a handle on it as quickly as possible.""

A Scottish startup says its prototype wave-energy device produced ""highly encouraging results.""

AWS Ocean announced that after six months at sea its Archimedes Waveswing produced more than 10 kilowatts during moderate wave conditions, with peaks as high as 80 kilowatts. That beat company expectations by 20 percent. 

The Archimedes Waveswing sits below the ocean's surface.

AWS Energy

Waveswing is a 50-ton buoylike device that's tethered to the ocean floor and sits below the water's surface. It uses the force of passing waves to generate power. Watch the video above to learn more about how Waveswing works.

AWS Ocean says its prototype survived force 10 gale conditions. This trial period, taking place off Scotland's Orkney Islands, is expected to wrap up before the end of the year, with more trials planned in 2023.
